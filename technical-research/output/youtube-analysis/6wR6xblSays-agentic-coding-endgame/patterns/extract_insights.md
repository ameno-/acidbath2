# INSIGHTS

• Custom agents require completely overwriting default system prompts
• System prompts multiply effectiveness across every single user interaction  
• Out-of-box agents waste tokens on irrelevant universal capabilities
• Multi-agent workflows enable true out-of-loop autonomous software development
• Agent coding shifts from capability to teaching specialized behaviors
• Custom tools built in-memory scale compute for domain problems
• Cheaper models work fine when intelligence requirements are low
• Context window pollution from unused tools degrades agent performance
