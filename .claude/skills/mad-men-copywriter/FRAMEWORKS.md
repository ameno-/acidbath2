## AIDA (Attention, Interest, Desire, Action)

### Overview
Classic direct response framework that moves reader from awareness to action through four stages.

### When to Use
- **Landing pages** - Full sales page structure
- **Email campaigns** - Move from subject line to click
- **Product descriptions** - Guide from feature to purchase
- **Long-form sales copy** - Build case systematically

### Structure Template

**Attention**: Grab focus with hook
- Pain point that resonates
- Shocking statistic
- Bold claim with proof promise

**Interest**: Build engagement with relevance
- Show you understand their situation
- Demonstrate the problem's impact
- Create "that's me" moment

**Desire**: Create want through benefits
- Paint before/after picture
- Specific outcomes, not features
- Social proof and credibility signals

**Action**: Drive conversion with clear CTA
- Specific action with specific benefit
- Remove friction/objections
- Add urgency without fake scarcity

### Mad Men Adaptation

**Attention**: Make it hurt or make it huge
```
❌ Weak: "Introducing our new email tool"
✅ Strong: "Your emails are invisible. 2% open rate means 98% wasted effort."
```

**Interest**: Agitate before soothing
```
❌ Weak: "Email marketing can be challenging"
✅ Strong: "You spent 10 hours writing that campaign. 200 people opened it. 3 clicked. Zero bought."
```

**Desire**: Show the transformation, be specific
```
❌ Weak: "Our tool helps improve your email performance"
✅ Strong: "40% open rates. 12% click-through. 3x more sales. Same list, better targeting."
```

**Action**: Benefit-driven, friction-free
```
❌ Weak: "Sign up to learn more"
✅ Strong: "Get your first campaign template - free, no credit card, 2-minute setup"
```

### Example: SaaS Landing Page

```markdown
**[Attention - Hook]**
Your dev team ships once a week. Your competition ships 10 times a day.

**[Interest - Agitate]**
Every delay is a missed opportunity. Every bug is lost revenue. Every manual
deployment is an hour your senior engineer isn't building features.

You're bleeding $50K/month in lost productivity.

**[Desire - Solution]**
Automated CI/CD that deploys in 8 minutes. Zero-downtime releases. Rollback
in one click. Your team ships with confidence, not fear.

GitHub merged at 3pm? Live at 3:08pm. Automatic.

**[Action - CTA]**
Start your free 14-day trial. No credit card. Deploy your first auto-release today.
```

## PAS (Problem, Agitate, Solution)

### Overview
Three-step framework that intensifies pain before presenting solution. Maximum urgency creation.

### When to Use
- **Pain-aware audiences** - They know they have a problem
- **Short-form copy** - Ads, subject lines, hooks
- **Conversion-focused CTAs** - Drive immediate action
- **Objection handling** - Address specific friction points

### Structure Template

**Problem**: Identify the pain clearly
- State it directly
- Make it specific
- Ensure "that's my problem" recognition

**Agitate**: Make it worse
- Show consequences
- Add urgency (time/money cost)
- Create fear of inaction

**Solution**: Present your offer
- Direct answer to stated problem
- Specific benefit addressing pain
- Easy path to resolution

### Mad Men Adaptation

**Problem**: Be blunt, be specific
```
❌ Weak: "Managing projects can be difficult"
✅ Strong: "Your projects are 3 months late and $200K over budget"
```

**Agitate**: Twist the knife
```
❌ Weak: "This can lead to challenges"
✅ Strong: "Next quarter's launch just got pushed to Q4. Your CEO is asking why. Your team is burned out. The competitor ships next week."
```

**Solution**: Promise specific relief
```
❌ Weak: "Our project management tool can help"
✅ Strong: "Hit every deadline. Track every dollar. Ship on time or get real-time alerts the second you're slipping."
```

### Example: Email Subject Line + Preview

```
**[Problem]**
Subject: Your A/B tests are lying to you

**[Agitate]**
Preview: 95% of your "winning" variants would fail with more traffic

**[Solution - implied in email]**
Body: Statistical significance calculator inside - know if your test is real or noise →
```

### Example: CTA Copy

```
**[Problem]**
Spending $10K/month on ads with no idea which ones work?

**[Agitate]**
Half your budget is burning. You just don't know which half.

## 4Ps (Picture, Promise, Prove, Push)

### Overview
Visualization-driven framework that creates mental imagery before pushing for action.

### When to Use
- **Aspirational products** - Lifestyle, transformation, status
- **Complex solutions** - Need to show end state before explaining
- **Emotional purchases** - Create desire before logic
- **Before/after messaging** - Highlight transformation

### Structure Template

**Picture**: Paint the desired end state
- Vivid imagery

- "You will..." statement

**Prove**: Back it with credibility
- Data, testimonials, case studies
- Proof that promise is achievable
- Reduce skepticism

**Push**: Drive to action
- Clear next step
- Benefit-driven CTA
- Urgency element

### Mad Men Adaptation

**Picture**: Make it visceral
```
❌ Weak: "Imagine having better analytics"
✅ Strong: "Picture this: 9am Monday. Coffee in hand. Dashboard shows exactly which marketing channel is bleeding money. You cut it before lunch. $5K/month back in your budget."
```

**Promise**: Specific and bold
```
❌ Weak: "You'll get better insights"
✅ Strong: "You'll know your cost-per-customer for every channel, updated real-time, by Friday."
```

**Prove**: Numbers and names
```
❌ Weak: "Many companies trust us"

```

**Push**: Eliminate friction
```

```

### Example: Product Launch Email

```markdown
**[Picture]**
Imagine deploying on Friday afternoon with zero anxiety. The code ships. Tests
pass. Monitoring shows green. You close your laptop and enjoy the weekend.

**[Promise]**
You'll ship 10x more often with 90% fewer bugs reaching production. Guaranteed.

**[Prove]**
Reddit's engineering team went from weekly deploys to 50/day with this exact
setup. Here's their VP of Engineering's writeup on how they did it →

## Before-After-Bridge (BAB)

### Overview
Contrast current pain state with desired future state, then bridge the gap with your solution.

### When to Use
- **Transformation products** - Clear before/after states
- **Pain-heavy audiences** - Currently struggling
- **Service descriptions** - Show outcome clearly
- **Testimonials and case studies** - Real transformations

### Structure Template

**Before**: Current painful state
- What's wrong now
- Specific struggles
- Relatable frustrations

**After**: Desired future state
- What life looks like solved
- Specific improvements
- Emotional and practical benefits

**Bridge**: Your solution connects them
- How you enable transformation
- What makes it possible
- Easy path from before to after

### Mad Men Adaptation

**Before**: Make current state sting
```
❌ Weak: "Without good testing, bugs happen"
✅ Strong: "Right now: Every deploy is Russian roulette. You push code and pray. Bugs reach production. Users report them before your monitoring does. Your weekend gets hijacked fixing emergencies."
```

**After**: Make future state irresistible
```
❌ Weak: "With our tool, testing is easier"
✅ Strong: "Imagine: Code merges trigger 500 automated tests. Bugs get caught in CI, never in production. You deploy 10x/day without stress. Sleep through the weekend."
```

**Bridge**: Show it's achievable now
```
❌ Weak: "Our testing platform enables better quality"
✅ Strong: "Our CI/CD pipeline runs your test suite on every commit. Zero config. Connect GitHub, we handle the rest. First automated deploy in under an hour."
```

### Example: Feature Announcement

```markdown
**[Before]**
Stop spending 10 hours/week manually testing the same user flows. Your QA team
is a bottleneck. Releases slip because "we need more testing time."

**[After]**
Ship confidently knowing 500 test cases run on every commit. Catch breaking
changes before code review. Deploy the second PR merges.

**[Bridge]**
Our automated testing suite integrates with your existing GitHub workflow.
Write tests once, run them forever. See your first automated test pass today →

## FAB (Features, Advantages, Benefits)

### Overview
Transform technical features into customer value through clear progression.

### When to Use
- **Technical products** - Need to translate specs to outcomes
- **Feature announcements** - Explain "so what?"
- **Comparison pages** - Show why features matter
- **Product descriptions** - Connect specs to value

### Structure Template

**Feature**: What it is (technical)
- Specification or capability
- The "what" of the product

**Advantage**: Why it's better (comparative)
- How it improves on alternatives
- The competitive edge

**Benefit**: What customer gets (outcome)
- Real-world result
- The "why you care"

### Mad Men Adaptation

Always lead with benefit, end with feature proof:

```
❌ Weak: "Our platform has real-time dashboards [Feature]. They update automatically [Advantage]. This helps you stay informed [Benefit]."

✅ Strong: "See problems the second they happen [Benefit]. Dashboards update in real-time, no refresh needed [Advantage]. Live data streaming via WebSocket [Feature]."
```

**Feature**: Be precise but brief
**Advantage**: Compare to alternatives or old way
**Benefit**: Make it personal ("You save 10 hours/week")

### Example: Feature List Transformation

```markdown
**Traditional FAB (weak)**:
- 256-bit encryption [F]
- More secure than competitors [A]
- Your data is protected [B]

**Mad Men FAB (strong)**:
- **Your customer data stays yours** [B]. Even we can't decrypt it [A]. 256-bit encryption, zero-knowledge architecture [F].

- **Sleep through the weekend instead of fighting fires** [B]. Auto-scale handles traffic spikes without you [A]. Kubernetes-based infrastructure [F].

- **Ship code 10x faster without breaking production** [B]. Bugs get caught in CI, never reach users [A]. 500 automated tests run on every commit [F].
```

## Slippery Slide

### Overview
Make each sentence pull reader to the next, creating unstoppable momentum toward CTA.

### When to Use
- **Long-form sales letters** - Maintain engagement throughout
- **Story-driven copy** - Build narrative tension
- **Educational content with CTA** - Teach while moving to action
- **Blog posts with conversion goal** - Keep reader moving

### Structure Template

Each element must:
1. **Deliver value** - Answer "why am I reading this?"
2. **Create curiosity** - "What comes next?"
3. **Lower friction** - Make continuing easier than stopping

### Mad Men Adaptation

**Sentence-level tactics**:
```
Short sentence. Grab attention.

Longer sentence that delivers value and creates curiosity about what's next.

Answer the question you just created. But raise a new one.

Repeat.
```

**Paragraph transitions**:
- End with hook for next section
- Use "Here's why" or "But there's a problem"
- Create open loop that demands closure

**Subhead strategy**:
- Make subheads benefit promises
- Each subhead sells the section
- "How to X" > "About X"

### Example: Blog Post Opening

```markdown
Your checkout flow is killing your revenue.

Sounds dramatic. But check your analytics. How many people add to cart? How
many actually complete purchase?

If you're like most online stores, you lose 70% between those two steps.

That's not a conversion problem. That's a $50K/month leak.

Here's what's happening: [continues with analysis, maintains momentum]
```

## Star-Story-Solution

### Overview
Case study framework that uses customer success stories to sell.

### When to Use
- **Social proof copy** - Testimonials and case studies
- **Skeptical audiences** - Need proof before belief
- **Complex transformations** - Story communicates better than stats
- **High-ticket sales** - Trust building critical

### Structure Template

**Star**: Introduce the customer
- Role/company to build relatability
- Situation before (relatable struggle)

**Story**: Document the journey
- What they tried
- What didn't work
- How your solution changed things
- Specific results

**Solution**: Connect to reader
- "You can do this too"
- How to get started
- CTA to begin their story

### Mad Men Adaptation

**Star**: Make them relatable
```
❌ Weak: "John Smith, CEO of TechCo"
✅ Strong: "Sarah was bleeding $30K/month on wasted ad spend. No idea which campaigns worked. Sound familiar?"
```

**Story**: Use concrete numbers
```
❌ Weak: "After using our platform, results improved significantly"
✅ Strong: "Month 1: Cut ad spend 40%, revenue stayed flat. Month 2: Reallocated savings to winning channels. Revenue up 23%. Month 3: Scaled winners, hit $100K/month."
```

**Solution**: Make it easy to start
```
❌ Weak: "You can achieve similar results with our platform"
✅ Strong: "Want Sarah's 40% savings? Connect your ad accounts in 90 seconds. See which campaigns are bleeding money in real-time."
```

### Example: Case Study Copy

```markdown
**[Star]**
Mike's SaaS was stuck at $50K MRR. Every marketing channel looked "pretty good"
in aggregate. But which one actually drove growth?

**[Story]**
He was spending:
- $8K/month on Google Ads (20 signups)
- $6K/month on Facebook (35 signups)
- $4K/month on LinkedIn (8 signups)

Our analytics showed the real story:
- Google Ads: $400/customer, LTV $300 → Losing $100 per customer
- Facebook Ads: $171/customer, LTV $450 → Printing money
- LinkedIn Ads: $500/customer, LTV $600 → Slight profit

He killed Google Ads. Doubled down on Facebook. Hit $80K MRR in 90 days.

**[Solution]**
See your numbers this clearly. Connect your ad accounts, get the real
cost-per-customer (not cost-per-click BS) in minutes →
```

## Application to suggest_edits

When generating Mad Men edit suggestions, identify which framework applies:

**In rationale, cite the framework**:
```
**Rationale**: Uses PAS framework - identifies specific problem ($50K waste),
agitates with consequence (competitor shipping faster), then presents solution
(automation). Creates urgency through pain-first approach.
```

**Match framework to section type**:
- Introduction → AIDA (Attention) or PAS (Problem)
- Concept explanation → FAB (Feature to Benefit)
- Failure mode → PAS (Agitate) or BAB (Before pain state)
- Takeaway → AIDA (Action) or BAB (After state)
- CTA → Any framework's Action/Solution step

This frameworks library gives every Mad Men suggestion a proven structure, not just aggressive energy.
