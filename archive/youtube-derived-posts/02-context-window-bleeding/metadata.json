  "summary": "MCP servers are convenient but wasteful—consuming 10,000+ tokens before your agent does any work. This analysis reveals three proven alternatives (CLI tools, file scripts, and Claude skills) that reduce context consumption by 50-92%, with a practical decision framework for when to use each approach.",
  "keyTakeaways": [
    "MCP servers consume 10,000+ tokens (5% of context window) before work begins",
    "Stacking 3+ MCP servers bleeds 20%+ of your context before typing a character",
    "CLI tools offer 50% context savings while maintaining full control",
    "File system scripts with progressive disclosure achieve 90% context reduction",
    "Claude skills provide 92%+ savings with automatic progressive disclosure",
    "The 80/15/5 rule: MCP for external tools (80%), CLI for control (15%), scripts for critical context (5%)",
    "Less garbage context = better agent performance and decision-making"
