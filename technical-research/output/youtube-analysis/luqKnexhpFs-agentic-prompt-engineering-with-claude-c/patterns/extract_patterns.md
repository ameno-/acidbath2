# PATTERNS

- Prompts are the fundamental unit of engineering in the agentic age
- Three audiences matter: you, your team, and your agents (stakeholder trifecta)
- Workflow section is the most important part of any agentic prompt
- Consistency beats complexity when designing reusable agentic prompts
- Variables enable dynamic and static information passing throughout prompts
- Seven levels of prompt complexity exist from ad hoc to template meta
- Input-workflow-output structure provides consistent three-step pattern for all prompts
- Composable sections work like Lego blocks that can be swapped in/out
- Control flow enables conditionals, loops, and early returns in agent workflows
- Delegation prompts allow agents to spawn and manage other agents
- Metadata sections specify tools, models, and constraints for agent execution
- Report sections control output format and structure from agents
- Instructions provide auxiliary information to aid workflow execution
- Context maps help agents navigate codebases without additional tool calls
- Natural language variable syntax improves readability for human stakeholders
- Agents are nondeterministic, requiring multiple instances for varied results
- Template meta prompts represent the highest level of agentic engineering capability
- Communication clarity reduces confusion for all three stakeholder types
- Reusable prompt libraries create force multipliers for engineering productivity
- Background prompts enable autonomous agent operation while continuing other work
- Static variables eliminate repetitive references throughout prompt structures
- XML blocks provide clear structure boundaries for complex workflow sections
- Direct tone of voice works better than conversational style for agents
- Workflow complexity can scale from simple lists to nested conditional structures
- Prompt engineering velocity scales dramatically with consistent templated approaches

# META

- Workflow section mentioned as "most important" and "S tier usefulness" multiple times
- Seven prompt levels referenced consistently: ad hoc, workflow, control flow, delegation, etc.
- Three-audience pattern (you, team, agents) emphasized throughout as "stakeholder trifecta"
- Input-workflow-output structure mentioned repeatedly as fundamental design pattern
- Consistency theme appears in every major section discussing prompt design
- Variable patterns shown in multiple examples: dynamic vs static, positional arguments
- Composable sections compared to "Lego blocks" in several different contexts
- Control flow examples demonstrated through multiple prompt samples (build, create image)
- Delegation complexity highlighted as "S tier useful, A tier difficulty" pattern
- Template meta prompts positioned as ultimate scaling solution for engineering velocity
- TAC (referenced course) mentioned as prerequisite foundation multiple times
- Claude Code examples used throughout to demonstrate practical implementation patterns
- Tier ranking system applied consistently to evaluate section usefulness vs difficulty

# ANALYSIS

The patterns reveal a systematic approach to agentic prompt engineering that prioritizes consistency, composability, and clear communication across human and AI stakeholders for maximum engineering productivity.

# BEST 5

- **Workflow section supremacy**: Consistently rated "S tier usefulness" and called "most important section" across all prompt examples, providing step-by-step agent execution plans that directly translate to productive work output.

- **Stakeholder trifecta design**: Every prompt must serve you, your team, and your agents equally well, mentioned throughout as the fundamental shift required for agentic engineering success.

- **Input-workflow-output pattern**: Universal three-step structure appearing in all seven prompt levels, providing consistent mental model for prompt design regardless of complexity level.

- **Composable Lego block sections**: Sections can be swapped in/out based on needs, mentioned repeatedly as key to scaling prompt engineering without rebuilding from scratch each time.

- **Consistency over complexity principle**: Emphasized throughout as the "greatest weapon against confusion" and key to engineering velocity, enabling rapid prompt creation and maintenance at scale.

# ADVICE FOR BUILDERS

- Start with workflow prompts before attempting advanced delegation or control flow patterns
- Build reusable prompt libraries with consistent section structures across your organization
- Focus on workflow section quality since it drives majority of productive output
- Use static variables to eliminate repetitive references and improve maintainability
- Design prompts assuming handoff to coworkers for clarity and consistency validation
- Implement input-workflow-output structure as default template for all new prompts
- Test prompts extensively before scaling to delegation or background execution modes
- Prioritize direct tone over conversational style when communicating with agents
- Create context maps for complex codebases to speed agent navigation
- Build composable sections that work across multiple prompt types and use cases
- Establish variable naming conventions early to maintain consistency across prompt libraries
- Use control flow sparingly until workflow sections are proven and stable
- Document prompt section purposes clearly for future team members and modifications
- Start simple with ad hoc prompts then systematically upgrade to workflow level
