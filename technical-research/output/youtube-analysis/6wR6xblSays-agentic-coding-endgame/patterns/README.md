5. Test with edge cases

### Tool Development
1. Write clear descriptions with examples
2. Validate all inputs
3. Return consistent output format
4. Handle errors gracefully
5. Keep tools focused (single responsibility)

### Model Selection
1. Start with Haiku, upgrade if needed
2. Match model to task complexity
3. Monitor costs per agent
4. Don't over-engineer simple tasks

### Agent Design
1. One agent, one purpose
2. Minimize tool count
3. Test behavior thoroughly
4. Monitor token usage
5. Iterate based on real usage

## Common Pitfalls

1. **Tool Bloat** - Including unnecessary tools
2. **Wrong Model** - Using expensive models for simple tasks
3. **Vague Prompts** - Not being specific enough
4. **Ignoring Context** - Not tracking context window usage
5. **Poor Tool Descriptions** - Agent doesn't know when to use tools
6. **Missing Validation** - Custom tools without input checks
7. **One-Size-Fits-All** - Generic agents for specialized work
