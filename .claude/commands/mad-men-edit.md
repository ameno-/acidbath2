# Mad Men Edit Command

Transform weak copy into conversion-focused content using the Mad Men Copywriter skill.

## Usage

```bash
/mad-men-edit {file_path}
```

**Example**:
```bash
/mad-men-edit content/landing-pages/product-launch.md
```

## What This Command Does

The `/mad-men-edit` command analyzes content for conversion opportunities and generates aggressive, results-driven edit suggestions using Mad Men copywriting principles.

**Process**:
1. ✅ Reads the content file (never writes/modifies)
2. 🔍 Identifies section types (introduction, cta, concept-explanation, etc.)
3. 🎯 Analyzes for conversion opportunities
4. ✏️ Generates edit suggestions with before/after comparisons
5. 📋 Outputs suggestions in suggest_edits format
6. ⛔ **Never modifies the original file**

## Focus Areas

Mad Men Copywriter prioritizes these improvements:

### 1. Headlines & Hooks
**Looks for**: Generic announcements, weak openings, no pain/value

**Transforms to**: Pain-first hooks, attention grabs, immediate value

**Example transformation**:
```
❌ "Introducing Our New Analytics Platform"
✅ "Stop Making $1M Decisions with Gut Feelings"
```

### 2. CTAs (Calls to Action)
**Looks for**: Generic actions ("learn more", "click here"), no benefit

**Transforms to**: Benefit-driven CTAs with specific value

**Example transformation**:
```
❌ "Click here to learn more"
✅ "See Your 40% Cost Savings - Free Calculator Inside"
```

### 3. Value Propositions
**Looks for**: Vague promises, corporate speak, buried benefits

**Transforms to**: Specific, quantified outcomes

**Example transformation**:
```
❌ "We help companies improve efficiency"
✅ "Ship 3x faster. Cut costs 40%. Same team, better tools."
```

### 4. Feature Descriptions
**Looks for**: Feature lists without benefits, technical specs without context

**Transforms to**: Outcome promises showing what customer achieves

**Example transformation**:
```
❌ "Real-time dashboards with custom reports"
✅ "See problems the second they happen. Build reports your CEO reads."
```

## Output Format

The command generates edit suggestions in standard suggest_edits format:

```markdown
# Edit Suggestions for {Content Title}

Generated by: Mad Men Copywriter
Date: {YYYY-MM-DD}

### Apply This Edit?

{Additional suggestions...}

## Sections Intentionally Preserved

The following sections were **not** edited to maintain technical accuracy:

- **{Section}** ({type}): {Reason}

---

## Application Notes

1. **Review rationale** - Understand conversion principle behind each suggestion
2. **Test CTAs** - Stronger CTAs should be A/B tested when possible
3. **Maintain brand voice** - Adapt suggestions to your specific tone
4. **Apply selectively** - Not all conversion copy fits every context

## Next Steps

- [ ] Review all suggested edits
- [ ] Apply selected edits to source file
- [ ] A/B test stronger CTAs against originals if possible
- [ ] Verify technical sections remain accurate
```

## Anti-Pattern Checks

The Mad Men skill automatically avoids these anti-patterns:

### ✅ Preserves Technical Sections
- Code blocks remain exact
- Benchmarks and data tables preserved
- Technical definitions maintain accuracy
- Configuration examples unchanged

### ✅ No Auto-Modification
- Command only outputs suggestions
- Original file never written
- User maintains full editorial control
- Suggestions can be rejected or modified

### ✅ Limits Suggestions
- Focuses on 5-8 high-impact changes
- Prioritizes hooks, CTAs, value props
- Doesn't suggest trivial tweaks
- Quality over quantity

### ✅ Provides Specific Rationale
- Every suggestion explains conversion principle
- Cites frameworks (PAS, AIDA, etc.)
- Shows why edit improves conversion
- Avoids vague "makes it better"

## When to Use This Command

### ✅ Perfect For

**Sales & Landing Pages**
- Product launches
- Pricing pages
- Lead generation pages
- Free trial signups

**Marketing Content**
- Email campaigns
- Ad copy (Google, Facebook, LinkedIn)
- Product descriptions
- Value proposition pages

**Conversion Points**
- CTAs throughout site
- Form copy
- Button text
- Email signups

### ❌ Not Suitable For

**Technical Documentation**
- API docs
- Configuration guides
- Troubleshooting pages
- Developer documentation

**Educational Content**
- Pure tutorials
- How-to guides (unless selling a course)
- Explainer articles
- Academic writing

**Code & Benchmarks**
- Code examples
- Performance tables
- Technical specifications
- Configuration files

**Thought Leadership**
- CEO blog posts
- Industry insights
- Trend analysis
- Use `/master-copy-edit` instead for persuasion over conversion

## Example Workflow

### 1. Create Your Draft
Write content in direct, clear voice. Don't worry about conversion optimization yet.

```markdown
# Our New Feature

We've built a new analytics dashboard. It has real-time data and custom reports.

Check it out.
```

### 2. Run Mad Men Edit
```bash
/mad-men-edit content/feature-announcement.md
```

### 3. Review Suggestions
```markdown
## Suggested Edit 1: Headline Hook

**Type**: introduction
**Rationale**: Uses pain-first approach (PAS framework) to create urgency
instead of generic announcement. Leads with specific pain point ($50K waste)
to grab attention immediately.

### Before
```
# Our New Feature
```

### After
```
# Stop Losing $50K/Month to Bad Data
```

### Apply This Edit?
- [ ] Yes, apply as-is
- [ ] Apply with modifications
- [ ] Skip this edit
```

### 4. Selectively Apply
Choose which edits fit your brand voice and goals. Modify as needed.

### 5. A/B Test (Recommended)
If possible, test stronger CTAs against originals to measure conversion impact.

## Command Implementation

When you invoke `/mad-men-edit`, here's what happens:

### Step 1: Read Content
```markdown
- Use Read tool to load file
- Verify file exists and is readable
- No modifications occur
```

### Step 2: Section Classification
```markdown
- Identify section boundaries (headers, paragraphs)
- Classify each section by type:
  - introduction, concept-explanation, failure-mode
  - takeaway, cta, technical, navigation
- Mark edit candidates vs preserve sections
```

### Step 3: Conversion Analysis
```markdown
For each editable section:
- Evaluate against Mad Men checklist:
  - Hook strength (pain-first? attention grab?)
  - Value deployment (benefit by word 50?)
  - CTA clarity (specific action + benefit?)
  - Weak sentence presence (hedging, passive voice)
  - Scannability (short paragraphs, bullets)

- If weaknesses found → Generate suggestion
- If already strong → Skip or minimal tweak
```

### Step 4: Generate Suggestions
```markdown
For each conversion opportunity:
- Extract exact original content (Before)
- Apply Mad Men transformation (After)
- Write specific rationale (framework + principle + impact)
- Format as standard suggest_edits template
```

### Step 5: Output Results
```markdown
- Summary of total suggestions
- Individual edit suggestions with before/after
- Preserved sections documentation
- Application notes and next steps
- NO file writing occurs
```

## Mad Men Checklist (Used During Analysis)

When analyzing content, the skill checks:

- [ ] **Pain-first hook** - Does intro lead with what hurts?
- [ ] **Value by word 50** - Core benefit visible in first 2 sentences?
- [ ] **Weak sentences eliminated** - Every sentence earns its place?
- [ ] **Active voice dominant** - "You get X" not "X is provided"?
- [ ] **Specific benefits** - Concrete outcomes not vague features?
- [ ] **Scannable** - Short paragraphs, bullets, bold?
- [ ] **Emotion + Logic + Proof** - All three elements present?
- [ ] **Strong CTA** - Clear action with specific benefit?
- [ ] **Urgency present** - Reason to act now not later?
- [ ] **Technical sections preserved** - Code/configs/benchmarks accurate?

Any failed checklist item is a candidate for editing.

## Troubleshooting

### "No suggestions generated"
**Possible reasons**:
- Content is already conversion-optimized
- Content is pure technical (no conversion opportunities)
- File path incorrect

**Solution**: Verify file path, ensure content has marketing/sales elements

### "Too many suggestions"
**Should not happen** - Skill limits to 5-8 high-impact suggestions

**If it does**: Report as bug - skill should be selective

### "Suggestions don't fit my brand voice"
**Expected** - Mad Men is aggressive by design

**Solution**:
- Use "Apply with modifications" option
- Tone down aggression while keeping principle
- Consider `/master-copy-edit` for softer persuasion

### "Technical sections got edited"
**Should not happen** - Skill preserves code/benchmarks

**If it does**: Report as bug - technical accuracy is guaranteed
