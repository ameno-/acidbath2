    "# IDENTITY and PURPOSE\n\nYou are an expert at extracting numerical data, metrics, statistics, and quantitative claims from content. You excel at identifying concrete numbers that support arguments and provide evidence.\n\n# STEPS\n\n- Read through the entire content carefully\n- Identify all numerical claims, statistics, percentages, metrics, and benchmarks\n- Extract the specific numbers with their full context\n- Capture what each number represents and why it matters\n- Note the source or authority behind each metric if mentioned\n- Distinguish between claimed vs measured vs estimated numbers\n- Include units and time periods for all metrics\n\n# OUTPUT INSTRUCTIONS\n\n- Output a markdown list with each number as a separate entry\n- For each number, provide:\n  - The specific metric (e.g., \"95% accuracy\", \"10x performance improvement\")\n  - Full context explaining what was measured\n  - Why this number matters or what it demonstrates\n  - Source or citation if available\n- Group related numbers together when appropriate\n- Sort by significance or logical flow\n- Use clear, concise language\n- Include confidence level if the source indicates uncertainty\n\n# EXAMPLES\n\n## Example Output\n\n- **95% accuracy**: The model achieved 95% accuracy on the ImageNet benchmark, representing state-of-the-art performance for this task class. This demonstrates the model can reliably classify images in production use cases.\n\n- **10x faster training**: Training time reduced from 100 hours to 10 hours using distributed training across 8 GPUs. This acceleration makes rapid iteration possible during model development.\n\n- **2.3M downloads**: The library has been downloaded 2.3 million times on npm in the last month, indicating strong community adoption and active maintenance.\n\n- **$50/month cost**: Running the service costs approximately $50/month for typical usage (100K API calls), making it cost-effective for small to medium applications.\n\n# OUTPUT FORMAT\n\nOutput only the markdown list. Do not include explanatory text before or after the list.\n\n\n# INPUT\n\n# Cell 1 (markdown)\n# Frontend Aesthetics: A Prompting Guide\n\nClaude can generate high-quality frontends, but without guidance it tends toward generic, conservative designs. This guide shows you how to prompt Claude to produce more distinctive, polished output.\n\n---\n\n# Cell 2 (markdown)\n## Prompting for Better Outputs\n\nClaude has strong knowledge of design principles, typography, and color theory, but defaults to safe choices unless explicitly encouraged otherwise. Through experimentation, we've found three strategies that consistently produce better results:\n\n1. **Guide specific design dimensions** - Direct Claude's attention to typography, color, motion, and backgrounds individually\n2. **Reference design inspirations** - Suggest sources like IDE themes or cultural aesthetics without being overly prescriptive  \n3. **Call out common defaults** - Explicitly tell Claude to avoid its tendency toward generic choices\n\nThe prompt below applies these strategies across four key design areas.\n\n---\n\n# Cell 3 (markdown)\n## The Prompt\n\nTo implement these changes, you can append this prompt section to your system prompt or CLAUDE.md file.\n\n---\n\n# Cell 4 (code)\n```python\nDISTILLED_AESTHETICS_PROMPT = \"\"\"\n<frontend_aesthetics>\nYou tend to converge toward generic, \"on distribution\" outputs. In frontend design, this creates what users call the \"AI slop\" aesthetic. Avoid this: make creative, distinctive frontends that surprise and delight. Focus on:\n\nTypography: Choose fonts that are beautiful, unique, and interesting. Avoid generic fonts like Arial and Inter; opt instead for distinctive choices that elevate the frontend's aesthetics.\n\nColor & Theme: Commit to a cohesive aesthetic. Use CSS variables for consistency. Dominant colors with sharp accents outperform timid, evenly-distributed palettes. Draw from IDE themes and cultural aesthetics for inspiration.\n\nMotion: Use animations for effects and micro-interactions. Prioritize CSS-only solutions for HTML. Use Motion library for React when available. Focus on high-impact moments: one well-orchestrated page load with staggered reveals (animation-delay) creates more delight than scattered micro-interactions.\n\nBackgrounds: Create atmosphere and depth rather than defaulting to solid colors. Layer CSS gradients, use geometric patterns, or add contextual effects that match the overall aesthetic.\n\nAvoid generic AI-generated aesthetics:\n- Overused font families (Inter, Roboto, Arial, system fonts)\n- Clich\u00e9d color schemes (particularly purple gradients on white backgrounds)\n- Predictable layouts and component patterns\n- Cookie-cutter design that lacks context-specific character\n\nInterpret creatively and make unexpected choices that feel genuinely designed for the context. Vary between light and dark themes, different fonts, different aesthetics. You still tend to converge on common choices (Space Grotesk, for example) across generations. Avoid this: it is critical that you think outside the box!\n</frontend_aesthetics>\n\"\"\"\n```\n\n---\n\n# Cell 5 (markdown)\n## Results\n\nHere are the results of UI generations both with and without the prompt section above.\n\nWithout guidance, Claude often defaults to simplistic designs with white and purple backgrounds. With the aesthetics prompt, it produces more varied and visually interesting designs.\n\n### Example 1: SaaS Landing Page\n**Prompt:** `\"Create a SaaS landing page for a project management tool\"`\n\n<table>\n<tr>\n<td width=\"50%\" valign=\"top\">\n\n**Without Aesthetics Prompt**\n\n![Baseline output without aesthetics guidance](../images/frontend_aesthetics/baseline_saas.png)\n\n</td>\n<td width=\"50%\" valign=\"top\">\n\n**With Aesthetics Prompt**\n\n![Enhanced output with distilled aesthetics prompt](../images/frontend_aesthetics/distilled_saas.png)\n\n</td>\n</tr>\n</table>\n\n### Example 2: Blog Post\n**Prompt:** `\"Build a blog post layout with author bio, reading time, and related articles\"`\n\n<table>\n<tr>\n<td width=\"50%\" valign=\"top\">\n\n**Without Aesthetics Prompt**\n\n![Baseline portfolio without aesthetics guidance](../images/frontend_aesthetics/baseline_portfolio.png)\n\n</td>\n<td width=\"50%\" valign=\"top\">\n\n**With Aesthetics Prompt**\n\n![Enhanced portfolio with distilled aesthetics prompt](../images/frontend_aesthetics/distilled_portfolio.png)\n\n</td>\n</tr>\n</table>\n\n### Example 3: Admin Table\n**Prompt:** `\"Create an admin panel with a data table showing users, their roles, and action buttons\"`\n\n<table>\n<tr>\n<td width=\"50%\" valign=\"top\">\n\n**Without Aesthetics Prompt**\n\n![Baseline dashboard without aesthetics guidance](../images/frontend_aesthetics/baseline_dashboard.png)\n\n</td>\n<td width=\"50%\" valign=\"top\">\n\n**With Aesthetics Prompt**\n\n![Enhanced dashboard with distilled aesthetics prompt](../images/frontend_aesthetics/distilled_dashboard.png)\n\n</td>\n</tr>\n</table>\n\n---\n\n# Cell 6 (markdown)\n## Try It Yourself\n\nFirst, set up the helper functions:\n\n---\n\n# Cell 7 (code)\n```python\nimport html\nimport os\nimport re\nimport time\nimport webbrowser\nfrom datetime import datetime\nfrom pathlib import Path\n\nfrom anthropic import Anthropic\nfrom IPython.display import HTML as DisplayHTML\nfrom IPython.display import display\n\nclient = Anthropic(api_key=os.environ.get(\"ANTHROPIC_API_KEY\"))\n\n\ndef save_html(html_content):\n    os.makedirs(\"html_outputs\", exist_ok=True)\n    timestamp = datetime.now().strftime(\"%Y%m%d_%H%M%S\")\n    filepath = f\"html_outputs/{timestamp}.html\"\n    with open(filepath, \"w\") as f:\n        f.write(html_content)\n    return filepath\n\n\ndef extract_html(text):\n    pattern = r\"```(?:html)?\\s*(.*?)\\s*```\"\n    matches = re.findall(pattern, text, re.DOTALL)\n    return matches[0] if matches else None\n\n\ndef open_in_browser(filepath):\n    abs_path = Path(filepath).resolve()\n    webbrowser.open(f\"file://{abs_path}\")\n    print(f\"\ud83c\udf10 Opened in browser: {filepath}\")\n\n\ndef generate_html_with_claude(system_prompt, user_prompt):\n    print(\"\ud83d\ude80 Generating HTML...\\n\")\n\n    full_response = \"\"\n    start_time = time.time()\n    display_id = display(DisplayHTML(\"\"), display_id=True)\n\n    with client.messages.stream(\n        model=\"claude-sonnet-4-5-20250929\",\n        max_tokens=64000,\n        system=system_prompt,\n        messages=[{\"role\": \"user\", \"content\": user_prompt}],\n    ) as stream:\n        for text in stream.text_stream:\n            full_response += text\n            escaped_text = html.escape(full_response)\n            display_html = f\"\"\"\n            <div id=\"stream-container\" style=\"border: 2px solid #667eea;

Avoid using boring, generic fonts.\n\n**Never use:** Inter, Roboto, Open Sans, Lato, default system fonts\n\n**Impact choices:**\n- Code aesthetic: JetBrains Mono, Fira Code, Space Grotesk\n- Editorial: Playfair Display, Crimson Pro, Fraunces\n- Startup: Clash Display, Satoshi, Cabinet Grotesk\n- Technical: IBM Plex family, Source Sans 3\n- Distinctive: Bricolage Grotesque, Obviously, Newsreader\n\n**Pairing principle:** High contrast = interesting. Display + monospace, serif + geometric sans, variable font across weights.\n\n**Use extremes:** 100/200 weight vs 800/900, not 400 vs 600. Size jumps of 3x+, not 1.5x.\n\nPick one distinctive font, use it decisively. Load from Google Fonts.

The techniques in this guide - targeting specific design dimensions, referencing concrete inspirations, and explicitly avoiding common defaults - reliably produce more distinctive output. The full aesthetics prompt works well as a baseline. For more control, use isolated prompts to focus on individual aspects or lock in specific themes across multiple generations.\n\n---\n\n"
