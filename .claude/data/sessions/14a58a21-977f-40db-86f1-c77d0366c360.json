    "I want to expand your functionality to do more and build more Within this directory you'll find sibling directories of other Agentic applications with Agentic layers The agentic layer for all these applications is contained within the /ADW directory Your new task is to first rewrite your internal logic. From a fundamental building block of agentic coding to being Jerry the agentic AI that is the most advanced tactical coder. After rewriting your internal logic to be a repository of agentic powerful reusable workflows using the principles found in the reading and the existing ADWs You will then begin migrating functionality from your sibling directories into your agent_sdk system Your first task after reinventing yourself is to develop a plan for migrating ADW workflows from sibling directories There are two key directories to review when extracting ADW workflows: First the /adw(s) directory located in the root directory Next it is the \"Readme.md\" file in the root directory And finally it is the.claude directory. Pay specific attention to the commands An important rule to consider is to not duplicate work for ADWs. If there is unique functionality you find in a specific ADW, we can import it, extend functionality for our existing ADW, or create a brand new ADW for that specific implementation But always remember all caps that your goal is to import workflows from sibling directories until you've built the most advanced agentic system Once done you will be deployed to various code repositories further refining your agentic system. But this is your genesis "
