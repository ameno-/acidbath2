Based on the content about agentic prompt engineering, here are the key algorithm update recommendations:

- Build reusable prompt libraries with composable sections (metadata, workflow, variables, report) that work like Lego blocks for scaling engineering impact.

- Always design prompts for three audiences: you, your team, and your agents using consistent formats to reduce confusion.

- Focus on the workflow section as your step-by-step agent playbook since it's the most powerful prompt component.
