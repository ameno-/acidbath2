Maybe it was a presentation, an analysis, or a report. What made it work? Claude brought intelligence and capability, but you also played a crucial part\u2014you explained your standards, you described the structure that works for your needs, you provided examples showing what you wanted, and you caught and fixed things that weren't quite right.\n\nInstead of having to repeat this process the next time you complete a similar task, Skills let you package what you've learned. Then, whenever the context matches, Claude applies the expertise automatically. You're not explaining the same standards repeatedly. You're not hunting for that document with your guidelines. You're not fixing generic output to match what you know works. Claude recognizes the situation, loads your approach, and applies it.\n\n**Why skills matter for your work**\n-----------------------------------\n\nYou have tasks where you've figured out what works\u2014a way of structuring reports, a framework for analysis, a style for client communication. But every time you start a new conversation with Claude, you're explaining it all over again or fixing the output to match your standards.\n\n\u200b**Skills solve this.**Package your approach once, and Claude applies it automatically in any chat.\n\n\u200b_\u200b**Before skills:**_ You ask Claude to create a quarterly business review. Claude can already build presentations, but making them match your standards means explaining your preferences each time. You could document guidelines in a Project, but they don't automatically apply when you need them.\n\n\u200b**_With skills:_** After creating a quarterly business review skill, you ask for the same presentation. Just by mentioning a task related to an existing skill\u2019s name or purpose, Claude can recognize it. In this case, Claude will load your QBR skill. In Claude\u2019s thinking you\u2019ll see \u201cReading QBR skill\u201d. It automatically applies your brand guidelines and preferred structure, generating a deck that matches your standards from the start.\n\n**Where Skills fit in how you already work with Claude**\n--------------------------------------------------------\n\n**Projects \u2014**You might already use Projects for certain work. Projects make sense when context accumulates over time. Think: a product launch with evolving plans, research that builds on previous findings, a campaign that unfolds over weeks. You can upload documents, build conversation history, and everything stays organized in one workspace. But Projects are bounded, and whatever context you upload to a project only exists there.\n\nSkills work everywhere. Create a Skill once, and it's available in any conversation\u2014regular chats, inside Projects, across all your work with Claude. Skills activate automatically when you reference them, regardless of where you're working.\n\nUse Skills for repeatable procedures you want applied automatically\u2014your brand guidelines, your analysis framework, your report format. Use Projects for work that needs accumulated context\u2014a product launch, a research project, an ongoing campaign. Use both together when your work benefits from persistent context and standardized procedures.\n\n**Custom Instructions** \u2014 You might also use custom instructions. These are preferences about how Claude works with you in general, like \"ask clarifying questions before starting\" or \"keep explanations concise.\" They apply universally to everything Claude does for you.\n\nUnlike custom instructions, Skills can contain far more detail. They can include extensive instructions, complete reference libraries and detailed frameworks that would otherwise clutter custom instructions.Skills are also specific to certain types of work and activate only when relevant. For example, \"When creating financial models, use this validation framework\" lives in a skill, as it won\u2019t apply to everything, only financial modeling work.\n\n**Regular prompting** \u2014 When you need Claude to do something once, just prompt well. Explain what you want, provide context, refine the output. This works perfectly for one-off tasks or exploratory work.\n\nSkills work differently. They are active everywhere you work with Claude. This means you\u2019re not re-uploading materials and re-explaining standards. Skills also combine automatically when work requires multiple areas of expertise, coordinating without you specifying each one.\n\nSkills also unlock higher quality outputs that would be difficult to achieve through prompting alone. They can package together complete reference libraries, validation frameworks, quality standards, and proven methodologies. This built-in expertise produces results that otherwise would require extensive explanation and rounds of prompting.\n\nRecognizing when a skill will help your work\n--------------------------------------------\n\nSkills range from simple formatting rules to complete workflows that pull data from multiple sources, analyze it, and generate reports. Create a skill when you've figured out how you want a task done and want Claude to follow that approach consistently. This applies in different situations:\n\n#### You've refined an approach through experience\n\nWhile working with Claude, you've figured out how something should be done, and find yourself explaining it to Claude multiple times. When you want Claude to follow that refined approach automatically rather than you explaining it fresh each time, that's a good skill opportunity.\n\n*   _Weekly team update skill:_ structures updates with wins, blockers, and priorities in the format that keeps meetings focused \n*   _Customer feedback analysis skill:_ categorizes responses, identifies patterns, surfaces priority requests\u2014your framework for making feedback actionable \n*   _Sales call prep skill:_ researches accounts, summarizes recent interactions, and generates talking points for effective calls \n*   _Research synthesis skill:_ evaluates sources, extracts key findings, identifies contradictions, and organizes by theme \n\n#### Quality depends on having specific materials\n\nSome work needs specific examples, templates, domain knowledge, or assets to meet your standards. Skills become powerful for packaging everything together so quality is consistent.\n\n*   _Brand compliance skill:_ bundles logo files, color codes, approved fonts, and layout templates for consistent company standards \n*   _Technical documentation skill:_ references notation guides, terminology standards, and uses diagram templates for documentation consistency \n*   _Legal contract skill:_ checks against standard terms, validates regulatory requirements, applies clause libraries and approval checklists \n\n#### Setup normally requires assembling multiple pieces\n\nEven occasional work might require gathering multiple files or tools, explaining how they work together, coordinating different requirements. Skills eliminate the setup burden\u2014package everything once and have it available whenever that situation arises.\n\n*   _Product launch skill:_ follows your messaging framework,generate contracts from your templates, creates tasks in project tracker \n*   _Market analysis skill:_ combines research frameworks, competitive benchmarks, and regulatory context into evaluations \n*   _Board presentation skill:_ pulls financial data, operational metrics, and strategic updates into quarterly reviews \n\n**Ready to create a skill?**\n----------------------------\n\nSkills are available as a preview to all paid plans. To get started, navigate to `Settings`>`Capabilities`>`Skills` and toggle on some of the pre-built example skills. From there, when you describe a task to Claude that references a skill\u2019s name or description, Claude recognizes it and loads the skill automatically.\n\nLearn how to write your own [custom skills](https://support.claude.com/en/articles/12512198-creating-custom-skills), incorporating guidance from our [skills best practices](https://docs.claude.com/en/docs/agents-and-tools/agent-skills/best-practices) to understand the principles that make skills most effective.\n\nYou also don\u2019t have to be technical to start creating skills. Try[creating skills using Claude](https://support.claude.com/en/articles/12599426-how-to-create-a-skill-with-claude-through-conversation). Start by identifying a well-suited task and describing it for Claude to turn into a skill. Claude will build and structure it into a properly formatted skill file.\n\n**Additional Resources**\n------------------------\n\n#### Getting started\n\n*   [Help Center: Using Skills](https://support.claude.com/en/articles/12512176-what-are-skills) - Setup and troubleshooting \n*   [How to create a skill with Claude](https://support.claude.com/en/articles/12599426-how-to-create-a-skill-with-claude-through-conversation) - Build your first Skill with Claude's guidance \n\n#### Going deeper\n\n*   [Skill authoring best practices](https://docs.claude.com/en/docs/agents-and-tools/agent-skills/best-practices) - Learn the principles behind effective Skills \n*   [Agent skills overview](https://docs.claude.com/en/docs/agents-and-tools/agent-skills/overview) - Understand how Skills work under the hood \n*   [Skill cookbooks](https://github.com/anthropics/claude-cookbooks/tree/main/skills) - Working examples you can adapt \n\n* * *\n\nRelated Articles\n\n[Claude for Financial Services Overview](https://support.claude.com/en/articles/12219959-claude-for-financial-services-overview)[What are Skills?](https://support.claude.com/en/articles/12512176-what-are-skills)[Using Skills in Claude](https://support.claude.com/en/articles/12512180-using-skills-in-claude)[How to create a skill with Claude through conversation](https://support.claude.com/en/articles/12599426-how-to-create-a-skill-with-claude-through-conversation)[Claude for Financial Services Skills](https://support.claude.com/en/articles/12663107-claude-for-financial-services-skills)\n\nDid this answer your question?\n\n\ud83d\ude1e\ud83d\ude10\ud83d\ude03\n\n[![Image 2: Claude Help Center](https://downloads.intercomcdn.com/i/o/487548/17213f6a445c8e6e874b1f4b/fad85208982e639d11b9108df895a293.png)](https://support.claude.com/en/)\n\n*   [Product](https://www.anthropic.com/product)\n*   [Research](https://www.anthropic.com/research)\n*   [Company](https://www.anthropic.com/company)\n*   [News](https://www.anthropic.com/news)\n*   [Careers](https://www.anthropic.com/careers)\n\n*   [Terms of Service - Consumer](https://www.anthropic.com/terms)\n*   [Terms of Service - Commercial](https://www.anthropic.com/legal/commercial-terms)\n*   [Privacy Policy](https://www.anthropic.com/privacy)\n*   [Usage Policy](https://www.anthropic.com/aup)\n*   [Responsible Disclosure Policy](https://www.anthropic.com/responsible-disclosure-policy)\n*   [Compliance](https://trust.anthropic.com/)"
