## RECOMMENDATION

### Watch Priority
High

### Reasoning
This video addresses a critical pain point for developers using AI coding agents on large codebases and provides concrete solutions with impressive performance improvements (20-30x faster, 28x fewer tokens). The presenter demonstrates real tools with measurable results rather than just theoretical concepts.

### Best Use Case
Essential viewing for developers who have experienced slow or inefficient AI coding agents on large projects, or anyone looking to optimize their AI-assisted development workflow with specialized tools.

### Time Investment Worth It?
Yes - The demonstrated performance improvements and specific tool recommendations provide immediate value that can save hours of development time and significantly reduce API costs for AI coding assistance.
