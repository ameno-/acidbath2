# ONE SENTENCE SUMMARY:
Prompts are engineering's fundamental unit, requiring consistent formats with composable sections for you, teams, and agents.

# MAIN POINTS:

1. Prompts become force multipliers with agents, generating hundreds of productive hours or compounding failures
2. Engineer for three audiences: yourself, your team, and your agents in the stakeholder trifecta
3. Build libraries of reusable, battle-tested agentic prompts with swappable Lego-block sections for scalability
4. Seven agentic prompt formats exist, with workflow prompts being the most important foundational level
5. Workflow section provides sequential task lists that agents execute, ranking S-tier usefulness with C-tier difficulty
6. Variables enable dynamic and static information passing, making prompts massively more valuable and reusable
7. Control flow prompts add conditions, loops, and early returns for sophisticated agent decision-making capabilities
8. Delegation prompts fire off sub-agents to accomplish parallel work, offering S-tier usefulness but A-tier difficulty
9. Consistent prompt formats reduce confusion and increase speed for all three stakeholder audiences significantly
10. Input-workflow-output structure provides reliable framework for designing effective reusable agentic prompts consistently

# TAKEAWAYS:

1. Master workflow prompts first as they form the foundation for all advanced agentic prompt engineering
2. Use consistent formatting and composable sections to create reusable prompt libraries that scale efficiently
3. Focus on the stakeholder trifecta when designing prompts: optimize for yourself, your team, and agents
4. Start simple with ad hoc prompts, then scale up through workflow and control flow levels
5. Invest heavily in prompt engineering as it dictates everything agents do and enables asymmetric engineering
