Sure that GitLab is treated as a new provider. It is a repository that has code. It also has access to issues. It also has access to comments. Merge requests can be commented on. Issues can be commented on. Schemas for comments and some of the nomenclature will be different. In order to integrate this new provider, we must implement a generic service or enhance the existing generic service for providers to support GitLab and all the features that it has access to without conflict. An issue or a code change will only exist with one provider. So GitLab or GitHub will host a set of issues, GitHub and GitLab will host a set of code repositories or what have you. The goal here is to make sure that we can access read issues from GitHub and read issues from GitLab and make the necessary code changes. And also ensure that when those code changes are being pushed, pull requests in Git for GitHub or merge requests for GitLab are being opened we must do it in the correct repository using the correct APIs. \\n\\nGoals\\nAdd Gitlab as a new provider\\nConsider core features: ADWs, slash commands, worktree isolation, multi-source issues\\nEmphasize scalability, observability, and composability\\nView the legacy implementation in legacy/tac-4 in the ADWs \\nMake sure that you use the existing ADW workflows for importing a workflow, validating a workflow \\nMake sure that documentation is updated after the workflow, the new workflow is integrated \\nMake sure that the new workflow is tested and verified after the implementation \\n\\nNon-goals\\nThe webhook implementation that exists inside the legacy/tac-4 repo will not be integrated into the app yet. That will be a separate plan \"}"
