# Divider Style Examples

Examples showing divider styles in context. Dividers are 2560x200 or 2560x300 pixels with NO TEXT—purely visual section separators.

## Minimal Line Examples

### Example 1: Subtle Technical Section Break

**Context**: Technical deep-dive transitioning from problem explanation to solution approach

**Filled Prompt**:
```
A minimalist horizontal divider line spanning the full width of the image. Ultra-wide format, very thin height.

The line: Single horizontal cyan (#00ffff) glowing line running left to right across center of frame. Line thickness: 3 pixels with soft glow/bloom extending upward and downward creating subtle atmosphere.

Background: Pure black (#000000).

Lighting: Subtle cyan glow emanating from the line. Soft bloom effect above and below.

Aesthetic: Clean, professional, unobtrusive.

NO text, symbols, or decorative elements besides the line and its glow.

Technical specifications: 2560x200 pixels, ultra-wide aspect ratio, optimized for section breaks.
```

## Tech Pattern Examples

### Example 2: Hexagonal Pattern for Architecture Post

**Context**: Separating system architecture overview from implementation details

**Filled Prompt**:
```
A horizontal strip of geometric technical patterns spanning full width. Ultra-wide format, moderate height.

The pattern: Repeating hexagonal tiles arranged horizontally across the strip. Hexagons in dim cyan (#008b8b) with subtle glow, evenly spaced with thin connection lines between adjacent hexagons.

Background: Deep charcoal (#1a1a1a). Pattern sits in center band.

Lighting: Soft cyan glow from hexagon edges. Subtle bloom.

Aesthetic: Technical, systematic, architectural. Organized hexagonal grid.

NO text or labels.

Technical specifications: 2560x300 pixels, ultra-wide aspect ratio.
```

## Glitch Break Examples

### Example 3: Paradigm Shift Divider

**Context**: Provocative post transitioning from "old way is wrong" to "new approach"

**Filled Prompt**:
```
A horizontal glitch corruption effect strip spanning full width. Digital disruption aesthetic.

The glitch effect: Horizontal band of digital corruption with RGB channel separation (cyan and magenta fringing offset horizontally), scanlines creating horizontal displacement, moderate corruption level.

Background: Deep black (#000000). Glitch effect concentrated in center horizontal band.

Corruption: Horizontal displacement, RGB separation, scanline artifacts, chromatic aberration.

Aesthetic: Digital dystopia, transition/shift between sections.

NO text.

Technical specifications: 2560x200 pixels, ultra-wide aspect ratio.
