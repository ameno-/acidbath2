## Suggested Edit 1: Opening Hook - Add Predictability Promise

**Type**: introduction
**Rationale**: Current opening is direct but doesn't promise a benefit. Mad Men principle: lead with what the reader gets, not what the workflow does.

### Before
```
The workflow section is the most important thing you'll write in any agentic prompt.

Not the metadata. Not the variables. Not the fancy control flow. The workflow—your step-by-step play for what the agent should do—drives 90% of the value you'll capture from AI-assisted engineering.
```

### After

The workflow section is the most important thing you'll write in any agentic prompt.

Not the metadata. Not the variables. Not the fancy control flow. The workflow—your step-by-step play for what the agent should do—drives 90% of the value you'll capture from AI-assisted engineering.

Get the workflow right, and your agent becomes predictable. Predictable means you can trust it. Trust means you can delegate to it.

## Suggested Edit 2: S-Tier Value Statement - Add Contrast

**Type**: concept-explanation
**Rationale**: The "S-tier usefulness with C-tier difficulty" line is excellent. Mad Men technique: extend the contrast to make it more memorable.

### Before
```
The workflow section is where your agent's actual work happens. It's rated S-tier usefulness with C-tier difficulty—the most valuable component is also the easiest to execute well.
```

### After
```
The workflow section is where your agent's actual work happens. It's rated S-tier usefulness with C-tier difficulty—the most valuable component is also the easiest to execute well.

You don't need to be a prompt engineer. You need to know how you'd explain the task to a competent colleague.

## Suggested Edit 3: Sequential Clarity - Add the "Why"

**Type**: concept-explanation
**Rationale**: The section explains what sequential steps do but not why they matter. Master Copywriter technique: connect mechanism to benefit.

### Before
```
**Sequential clarity** - Numbered steps eliminate ambiguity. The agent knows exactly what order to execute.
```

### After
```
**Sequential clarity** - Numbered steps eliminate ambiguity. The agent knows exactly what order to execute—and so do you when something goes wrong.

## Suggested Edit 4: Database Migration Failure - Add Personal Cost

**Type**: failure-mode
**Rationale**: Master Copywriter principle—personal failures are more credible than hypothetical ones. The database migration story is good but needs a cost.

### Before
```
**Overly complex tasks requiring human judgment mid-execution**

I tried building a workflow prompt for database migration planning. The prompt could analyze schema differences and generate SQL, but it couldn't decide which migrations were safe to auto-apply versus which needed DBA review.
```

### After
```
**Overly complex tasks requiring human judgment mid-execution**

I tried building a workflow prompt for database migration planning. The prompt could analyze schema differences and generate SQL, but it couldn't decide which migrations were safe to auto-apply versus which needed DBA review.

Two hours into writing the prompt, I realized I'd spent more time on the workflow than the migration would have taken.

## Suggested Edit 5: Content Generation Failure - Add Specific Waste

**Type**: failure-mode
**Rationale**: The "300-line workflow prompt" example is powerful. Mad Men technique: quantify what that wasted time could have produced instead.

### Before
```
I wrote a 300-line workflow prompt for content generation that included 15 different quality checks and formatting rules. The agent followed it perfectly and produced consistently mediocre output. The problem wasn't execution—it was that I couldn't articulate "make it interesting" in workflow steps.

Three hours of prompt engineering. Zero usable content. I could have written five blog posts in that time.

## Suggested Edit 6: Break-Even Math - Add Visual Emphasis

**Type**: takeaway
**Rationale**: The break-even formula is the key insight but doesn't stand out. Mad Men technique: make the formula unmissable.

### Before
```
Task execution time varies, but here's the break-even math:

```
Break-even uses = (Time to write prompt) / (Time saved per use)
```
```

### After
```
Task execution time varies, but here's the break-even math:

```
Break-even uses = (Time to write prompt) / (Time saved per use)
```

**This formula should guide every workflow decision.** If the math doesn't work, don't build it.

## Suggested Edit 7: Multiplier Effect - Add Team ROI

**Type**: takeaway
**Rationale**: The team multiplier is mentioned but undersold. Mad Men technique: make the multiplication feel tangible.

### Before
```
**The multiplier effect**

This calculation assumes only you use the workflow. If your team uses it, divide break-even by team size.

A 30-minute workflow prompt on a 5-person team needs to save each person just 6 minutes once to break even. That's a no-brainer for common tasks like "add API endpoint," "generate test file," or "create component boilerplate."
```

### After

**The real win:** That 30 minutes you spent becomes 30 minutes × 5 people × every use. A workflow used 10 times by a 5-person team generates 25 hours of value from a 30-minute investment.

## Suggested Edit 8: Closing Statement - Make It Memorable

**Type**: takeaway
**Rationale**: "The prompt is the new fundamental unit of engineering" is a strong claim. Mad Men technique: extend it to make it quotable.

### Before
```
Test it. Iterate. Add to your library.

The prompt is the new fundamental unit of engineering. The workflow section is where that engineering actually happens.
```

### After
```
Test it. Iterate. Add to your library.

The prompt is the new fundamental unit of engineering. The workflow section is where that engineering actually happens.

**One workflow prompt executing for an hour can replace twenty hours of manual work.** That's not automation. That's multiplication.

## Application Notes

1. **Edits 1, 2** strengthen the value proposition immediately (Mad Men)
2. **Edits 3** connects mechanism to benefit (Master)
3. **Edits 4, 5** add personal cost to failure stories (Master honesty + Mad Men pain)
4. **Edits 6, 7** emphasize ROI math visually (Mad Men)
5. **Edit 8** makes the closing quotable (Mad Men)

## Suggested Combination Strategies

**Conservative (Master focus)**: Apply edits 3, 4, 5
- Adds personal credibility to failure modes
- Keeps narrative structure intact
- Minimal changes to flow

**Moderate (Balanced)**: Apply edits 1, 2, 6, 7, 8
- Opens with predictability promise
- Strengthens S-tier/C-tier framing
- Emphasizes break-even math
- Closes memorably

**Aggressive (Full Mad Men + Master)**: Apply all 8 edits
- Maximum engagement
- Personal failure costs
- Team ROI multiplication
- Quotable closing

## Recommended: Moderate Strategy

This post is already excellent—clear structure, good examples, solid ROI math. The moderate strategy:
- Adds the "predictability → trust → delegation" progression at the top
- Makes the value proposition more memorable
- Emphasizes the break-even formula as the decision framework
- Closes with a quotable "multiplication" line

The failure mode edits (4, 5) are optional—the post already does a good job showing failures, adding personal cost makes them more memorable but isn't essential.
