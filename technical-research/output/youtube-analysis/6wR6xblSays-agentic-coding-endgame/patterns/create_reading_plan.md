# ABOUT THIS READING PLAN

It sounds like you're interested in agentic engineering and building custom AI agents, so here's a reading plan to help you learn more about that.

# PHASE 1: Core Reading

- **Designing Data-Intensive Applications**, by Martin Kleppmann. This book was chosen because it establishes foundational distributed systems thinking essential for multi-agent architectures.

- **The Pragmatic Programmer**, by David Thomas and Andrew Hunt. This book was chosen because it covers software engineering principles crucial for building scalable agent systems.

- **Clean Architecture**, by Robert C. Martin. This book was chosen because it teaches system design patterns that apply directly to agent orchestration frameworks.

# PHASE 2: Extended Reading

- **Patterns of Enterprise Application Architecture**, by Martin Fowler. This book was chosen because it provides architectural patterns for building complex distributed agent systems.

- **Building Microservices**, by Sam Newman. This book was chosen because agent systems often follow microservice patterns with independent, communicating components.

- **Site Reliability Engineering**, by Betsy Beyer et al. This book was chosen because it covers operational concerns essential for production agent deployments.

- **The Phoenix Project**, by Gene Kim et al. This book was chosen because it demonstrates DevOps workflows that parallel agent-driven development lifecycles.

- **Accelerate**, by Nicole Forsgren et al. This book was chosen because it provides metrics and practices for high-performing engineering teams using automation.

# PHASE 3: Exploratory Reading

- **The Art of Unix Programming**, by Eric S. Raymond. This book was chosen because it teaches composability principles fundamental to agent system design.

- **Release It!**, by Michael Nygard. This book was chosen because it covers stability patterns crucial for reliable agent systems.

- **Working Effectively with Legacy Code**, by Michael Feathers. This book was chosen because it teaches refactoring techniques needed when integrating agents into existing codebases.

- **Domain-Driven Design**, by Eric Evans. This book was chosen because it provides modeling techniques for creating domain-specific custom agents.

- **The Lean Startup**, by Eric Ries. This book was chosen because it teaches iterative development approaches perfect for agent experimentation.

- **Thinking in Systems**, by Donella Meadows. This book was chosen because it provides mental models for understanding complex agent interactions.

- **The Mythical Man-Month**, by Frederick Brooks Jr. This book was chosen because it offers timeless insights on software complexity relevant to agent orchestration.

# OUTLINE SUMMARY

This reading plan will give you a solid foundation in systems thinking and software engineering and will allow you to branch out from there.
