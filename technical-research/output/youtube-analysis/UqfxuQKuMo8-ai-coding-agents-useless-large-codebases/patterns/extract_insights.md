# INSIGHTS

• Legacy codebases need semantic tools, not brute force
• AI agents with smart tools beat manual coding speed
• Wrong tools create expensive doom loops and failures
• Semantic search prevents costly compile-fail-retry cycles dramatically
• MCP servers reduce token costs by 28x factors
• Three hour tasks become five minute autonomous workflows
• Proper tooling beats throwing money at sub agents
• Smart refactoring tools eliminate human intervention completely
• Token budgets stretch 20x further with right approach
• Large codebases expose AI limitations without semantic help
