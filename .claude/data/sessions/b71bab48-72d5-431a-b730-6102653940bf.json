    "# IDENTITY and PURPOSE\n\nYou are an expert at identifying failure modes, edge cases, known issues, anti-patterns, and gotchas in technical content. You excel at extracting the \"what could go wrong\" scenarios that practitioners need to know.\n\n# STEPS\n\n- Read through the entire content carefully\n- Identify all mentioned failure scenarios, bugs, edge cases, and limitations\n- Extract anti-patterns and common mistakes that lead to problems\n- Capture known issues and workarounds\n- Note gotchas and surprising behaviors\n- Identify performance bottlenecks or scalability limitations\n- Extract security vulnerabilities or risks if mentioned\n- Look for \"don't do this\" warnings and cautionary advice\n\n# OUTPUT INSTRUCTIONS\n\n- Output a markdown list with each failure mode as a separate entry\n- For each failure mode, provide:\n  - Clear name/title for the failure mode\n  - Description of what goes wrong and when\n  - Impact or consequences of this failure\n  - Workaround or mitigation if mentioned\n  - Root cause if explained\n- Group related failure modes together when appropriate\n- Sort by severity or likelihood\n- Use clear, actionable language\n- Distinguish between:\n  - Design limitations (inherent constraints)\n  - Implementation bugs (fixable issues)\n  - User errors (misuse patterns)\n  - Environmental factors (deployment/config issues)\n\n# EXAMPLES\n\n## Example Output\n\n- **Race condition in concurrent writes**: When multiple threads write to the same cache key simultaneously, the last write wins without any locking mechanism. This can cause data loss in high-concurrency scenarios. **Mitigation**: Use the atomic compare-and-swap operations instead of direct writes. **Impact**: Data corruption in distributed systems.\n\n- **Memory leak with large file uploads**: Files larger than 100MB are loaded entirely into memory during processing, causing gradual memory exhaustion under load. **Root cause**: Missing streaming implementation for large payloads. **Mitigation**: Use chunked uploads or increase memory limits. **Impact**: Service crashes after processing 50-100 large files.\n\n- **Silent failure on network timeout**: Network requests that timeout (>30s) fail silently without logging or retry, making debugging difficult. **Impact**: Intermittent data sync failures that appear as missing records. **Mitigation**: Enable debug logging and implement retry logic with exponential backoff.\n\n- **Performance degrades with deep nesting**: Query performance drops exponentially with nested data structures deeper than 5 levels due to recursive serialization. **Root cause**: O(n\u00b2) complexity in the serializer. **Impact**: 100x slower queries for deeply nested data. **Mitigation**: Flatten data structures or use iterative serialization.\n\n# OUTPUT FORMAT\n\nOutput only the markdown list. Do not include explanatory text before or after the list.\n\n\n# INPUT\n\n# Cell 1 (markdown)\n# Parallel tool calls on Claude 3.7 Sonnet\n\n---\n\n# Cell 2 (markdown)\nClaude 3.7 Sonnet may be less likely to make make parallel tool calls in a response, even when you have not set `disable_parallel_tool_use`. To work around this, we recommend introducing a \"batch tool\" that can act as a meta-tool to wrap invocations to other tools simultaneously. We find that if this tool is present, the model will use it to simultaneously call multiple tools in parallel for you.\n\nLet's take a look at the problem, and examine this workaround in more detail.\n\n---\n\n# Cell 3 (code)\n```python\nfrom anthropic import Anthropic\n\nclient = Anthropic()\nMODEL_NAME = \"claude-sonnet-4-5\"\n```\n\n---\n\n# Cell 4 (markdown)\n## Performing a query with multiple tool calls\n\nRecall that the default behavior is for Claude to be allowed parallel tool calls. Combined with the default `tool_choice` of `auto`, this means that Claude can call any of the specified tools, or call more than one of them in a single assistant turn.\n\nLet's set Claude up with a `get_weather` and `get_time` tool.\n\n---\n\n# Cell 5 (code)\n```python\ndef get_weather(location):\n    # Pretend to get the weather, and just return a fixed value.\n    return f\"The weather in {location} is 72 degrees and sunny.\"\n\n\ndef get_time(location):\n    # Pretend to get the time, and just return a fixed value.\n    return f\"The time in {location} is 12:32 PM.\"\n\n\nweather_tool = {\n    \"name\": \"get_weather\",\n    \"description\": \"Gets the weather for in a given location\",\n    \"input_schema\": {\n        \"type\": \"object\",\n        \"properties\": {\n            \"location\": {\n                \"type\": \"string\",\n                \"description\": \"The city and state, e.g. San Francisco, CA\",\n            },\n        },\n        \"required\": [\"location\"],\n    },\n}\n\ntime_tool = {\n    \"name\": \"get_time\",\n    \"description\": \"Gets the time in a given location\",\n    \"input_schema\": {\n        \"type\": \"object\",\n        \"properties\": {\n            \"location\": {\n                \"type\": \"string\",\n                \"description\": \"The city and state, e.g. San Francisco, CA\",\n            },\n        },\n        \"required\": [\"location\"],\n    },\n}\n\n\ndef process_tool_call(tool_name, tool_input):\n    if tool_name == \"get_weather\":\n        return get_weather(tool_input[\"location\"])\n    elif tool_name == \"get_time\":\n        return get_time(tool_input[\"location\"])\n    else:\n        raise ValueError(f\"Unexpected tool name: {tool_name}\")\n```\n\n---\n\n# Cell 6 (markdown)\nNext, let's provide Claude with these tools and perform a query.\n\n---\n\n# Cell 7 (code)\n```python\ndef make_query_and_print_result(messages, tools=None):\n    response = client.messages.create(\n        model=MODEL_NAME,\n        messages=messages,\n        max_tokens=1000,\n        tool_choice={\"type\": \"auto\"},\n        tools=tools or [weather_tool, time_tool],\n    )\n\n    for block in response.content:\n        match block.type:\n            case \"text\":\n                print(block.text)\n            case \"tool_use\":\n                print(f\"Tool: {block.name}({block.input})\")\n            case _:\n                raise ValueError(f\"Unexpected block type: {block.type}\")\n\n    return response\n\n\nMESSAGES = [{\"role\": \"user\", \"content\": \"What's the weather and time in San Francisco?\"}]\n\nresponse = make_query_and_print_result(MESSAGES)\n```\n\n**Output:**\n```\nI'll check the current weather and time in San Francisco for you.\nTool: get_weather({'location': 'San Francisco, CA'})\n\n```\n\n---\n\n# Cell 8 (markdown)\nNotice how claude returned with a single tool call for the weather, even though we asked for both?\n\nLet's see what happens if we call the weather tool and proceed.\n\n---\n\n# Cell 9 (code)\n```python\nlast_tool_call = response.content[1]\n\nMESSAGES.append({\"role\": \"assistant\", \"content\": response.content})\nMESSAGES.append(\n    {\n        \"role\": \"user\",\n        \"content\": [\n            {\n                \"type\": \"tool_result\",\n                \"tool_use_id\": last_tool_call.id,\n                \"content\": process_tool_call(response.content[1].name, response.content[1].input),\n            }\n        ],\n    }\n)\n\nresponse = make_query_and_print_result(MESSAGES)\n```\n\n**Output:**\n```\nTool: get_time({'location': 'San Francisco, CA'})\n\n```\n\n---\n\n# Cell 10 (markdown)\nNotice now that Claude made a second tool call to get the time. While this technically happened immediately, this is potentially wasteful because it required \"back and forth\" \u2013 first Claude asked for the weather, then we had to process it, and _then_ Claude asked for the time, and now we have to process _that_.\n\nClaude will still do the right thing with the results, but it may be beneficial to encourage Claude to use both in one call, so we can process it simultaneously.\n\n---\n\n# Cell 11 (markdown)\n## Introducing a batch tool\n\nLet's introduce a `batch_tool`, so that Claude can have an opportunity to use it to combine multiple tool calls into one.\n\n---\n\n# Cell 12 (code)\n```python\nimport json\n\nbatch_tool = {\n    \"name\": \"batch_tool\",\n    \"description\": \"Invoke multiple other tool calls simultaneously\",\n    \"input_schema\": {\n        \"type\": \"object\",\n        \"properties\": {\n            \"invocations\": {\n                \"type\": \"array\",\n                \"description\": \"The tool calls to invoke\",\n                \"items\": {\n                    \"types\": \"object\",\n                    \"properties\": {\n                        \"name\": {\n                            \"types\": \"string\",\n                            \"description\": \"The name of the tool to invoke\",\n                        },\n                        \"arguments\": {\n                            \"types\": \"string\",\n                            \"description\": \"The arguments to the tool\",\n                        },\n                    },\n                    \"required\": [\"name\", \"arguments\"],\n                },\n            }\n        },\n        \"required\": [\"invocations\"],\n    },\n}\n\n\ndef process_tool_with_maybe_batch(tool_name, tool_input):\n    if tool_name == \"batch_tool\":\n        results = []\n        for invocation in tool_input[\"invocations\"]:\n            results.append(\n                process_tool_call(invocation[\"name\"], json.loads(invocation[\"arguments\"]))\n            )\n        return \"\\n\".join(results)\n    else:\n        return process_tool_call(tool_name, tool_input)\n```\n\n---\n\n# Cell 13 (markdown)\nNow let's try to provide Claude with the existing weather and time tool, along with this new batch tool, and see what happens when we make a query requiring the weather and time.\n\n---\n\n# Cell 14 (code)\n```python\nMESSAGES = [{\"role\": \"user\", \"content\": \"What's the weather and time in San Francisco?\"}]\n\nresponse = make_query_and_print_result(MESSAGES, tools=[weather_tool, time_tool, batch_tool])\n```\n\n**Output:**\n```\nI can help you check both the weather and the time in San Francisco. Let me get that information for you right away.\nTool: batch_tool({'invocations': [{'name': 'get_weather', 'arguments': '{\"location\": \"San Francisco, CA\"}'}, {'name': 'get_time', 'arguments': '{\"location\": \"San Francisco, CA\"}'}]})\n\n```\n\n---\n\n# Cell 15 (markdown)\nNotice how this time, Claude used the batch tool to query both the time and weather in one go. This allows us to process them simultaneously, potentially improving overall latency to the result.\n\n---\n\n# Cell 16 (code)\n```python\nlast_tool_call = response.content[1]\n\nMESSAGES.append({\"role\": \"assistant\", \"content\": response.content})\nMESSAGES.append(\n    {\n        \"role\": \"user\",\n        \"content\": [\n            {\n                \"type\": \"tool_result\",\n                \"tool_use_id\": last_tool_call.id,\n                \"content\": process_tool_with_maybe_batch(\n                    response.content[1].name, response.content[1].input\n                ),\n            }\n        ],\n    }\n)\n\nresponse = make_query_and_print_result(MESSAGES)\n```\n\n**Output:**\n```\nHere's the information you requested:\n\nWeather in San Francisco, CA: 72 degrees and sunny\nTime in San Francisco, CA: 12:32 PM\n\nIs there anything else you'd like to know about San Francisco?\n\n```\n\n---\n\n"
