# Controversial Ideas

- Prompts are now the fundamental unit of engineering, replacing traditional coding practices
- Engineers must now design for three audiences: themselves, teams, and AI agents
- Most engineers haven't made the necessary "agentic shift" in their engineering mindset
- Winners will build libraries of reusable prompts like Lego blocks for scaling
- Traditional engineering approaches are becoming obsolete in the age of AI agents
- Agents can now run for hours autonomously with minimal human supervision required
- Engineering velocity scales dramatically when you template your agentic prompt engineering processes
- Consistency beats complexity as the primary engineering principle in AI-driven development
- Engineers who don't adapt to agent-first development will become replaceable in phase two
- The future of engineering involves getting "out of the loop" from agents
- Traditional back-and-forth prompting experiences are inefficient and should be eliminated
- Agent delegation represents the future where engineers manage compute rather than code
- Prompt engineering skill determines engineering impact more than traditional coding abilities
- Most engineers only need basic prompt formats to capture majority of value
- Engineering is transitioning from human-centered to agent-centered development paradigms

# Supporting Quotes

- "The prompt is now the fundamental unit of engineering"
- "This is the agentic shift that most engineers haven't yet made"
- "We are now agentic prompt engineering and every prompt you write has the ability to call tens and hundreds of tool calls"
- "The winners here are building libraries of reusable battle tested agentic prompts"
- "Engineering is not just about your agents. It's not just about you. It's not just about your team"
- "You need to hit the trifecta. All right, the stakeholder trifecta for the age of agents"
- "This is the future of engineering. Once you build up great agents that perform for you and get work done, the next question is how many agents can you spin up?"
- "Consistency beats complexity. Consistency makes you faster"
- "The prompt is the fundamental unit of engineering. Invest in your prompts for the trifecta to achieve asymmetric engineering"
- "It helps you move toward becoming an irreplaceable engineer in phase two of the generative AI age"
- "Tact is all about scaling up what you can do with agents. It's about getting out the loop"
