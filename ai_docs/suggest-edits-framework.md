# Suggest Edits Framework

## Purpose and Philosophy

The **suggest_edits framework** is a copywriting and editorial pattern that **suggests** targeted improvements to content without automatically applying changes. This preserves editorial control while enabling strategic personality injection across different writing styles.

### Core Principles

1. **Suggest, Don't Auto-Apply**: Never modify files. Generate edit suggestions with clear before/after comparisons.
2. **Rationale Required**: Every suggestion must explain why the edit improves the content.
3. **Selective Application**: Users decide which edits to apply, reject, or modify.
4. **Section-Aware**: Classify content sections by type and only suggest edits where appropriate.
5. **Preserve Technical Accuracy**: Never compromise code, benchmarks, or factual content for style.

### Why This Pattern?

**Problem**: Auto-applying copywriting changes risks:
- Overwriting user voice and intent
- Introducing errors in technical content
- Applying inappropriate personality to formal sections
- Loss of editorial control

**Solution**: The suggest_edits pattern gives users:
- Full visibility into proposed changes
- Control over which edits to accept
- Understanding of *why* each edit improves content
- Ability to modify suggestions before applying

## Edit Suggestion Data Structure

### Required Fields

Every edit suggestion must include:

| Field | Type | Description |
|-------|------|-------------|
| `section_name` | string | Descriptive name of the section being edited (e.g., "Introduction Hook", "Call to Action") |
| `type` | enum | Section type classification (see types below) |
| `rationale` | string | Clear explanation of why this edit improves the content |
| `before` | string | Original content exactly as it appears |
| `after` | string | Suggested replacement content |

### Section Types

Classify sections using these types:

- **`introduction`**: Opening paragraphs, hooks, lead sections
- **`concept-explanation`**: Explanations of ideas, techniques, or approaches
- **`failure-mode`**: Discussions of what can go wrong, pitfalls, challenges
- **`takeaway`**: Conclusions, summaries, key lessons
- **`cta`**: Calls-to-action, next steps, conversion points
- **`technical`**: Code examples, benchmarks, configuration, implementation details (usually DO NOT edit)
- **`navigation`**: Table of contents, section headers, organizational elements (usually DO NOT edit)

### Section Type Guidelines

**Editable sections** (personality candidates):
- `introduction` - Can add hooks, improve engagement
- `concept-explanation` - Can simplify, add clarity, inject personality
- `failure-mode` - Can add conversational honesty, relatability
- `takeaway` - Can make memorable, add impact
- `cta` - Can strengthen conversion, clarify action

**Preserve-as-is sections**:
- `technical` - Code, configs, benchmarks must stay accurate
- `navigation` - TOCs and headers should stay direct

**Focus Areas**:
- {Primary improvement area 1}
- {Primary improvement area 2}
- {Primary improvement area 3}

---

{Repeat for each suggestion using template above}

---

## Sections Intentionally Preserved

The following sections were **not** edited to maintain {accuracy/directness/technical integrity}:

- **{Section Name}** ({type}): {Brief reason why preserved}
- **{Section Name}** ({type}): {Brief reason why preserved}

---

## Application Notes

1. **Review rationale** for each suggestion before applying
2. **Test technical sections** if modified (should be rare)
3. **Maintain your voice** - modify suggestions to match your style
4. **Apply selectively** - not all suggestions may fit your intent

## Next Steps

- [ ] Review all suggested edits
- [ ] Apply selected edits to source file
- [ ] Re-read for consistency after applying
- [ ] Verify technical accuracy if code/config sections touched
```

## Implementation Guidelines for Skill Creators

### How to Implement suggest_edits in a Skill

#### Step 1: Read and Analyze Content

```markdown
1. **Read the content file** using the Read tool
2. **Identify section boundaries** (headings, paragraphs, code blocks)
3. **Classify each section** by type (introduction, concept-explanation, etc.)
4. **Determine edit candidates** based on skill focus and section type
```

#### Step 2: Generate Suggestions

For each section that merits editing:

```markdown
1. **Extract original content** exactly as written
2. **Apply skill-specific transformation** (conversion focus, persuasion, simplification, etc.)
3. **Write clear rationale** explaining:
   - What problem the edit solves
   - How it improves the content
   - What technique/framework is being applied
4. **Format suggestion** using standard template
```

#### Step 3: Output Suggestions

```markdown
1. **Never write to files** - only output suggestions
2. **Use complete output format** with summary and preserved sections
3. **Limit suggestions** to high-impact changes (typically 5-10 per document)
4. **Group related edits** when multiple changes improve the same section
```

### Anti-Patterns to Avoid

❌ **Don't**: Auto-apply changes to files
✅ **Do**: Output suggestions only

❌ **Don't**: Suggest edits without rationale
✅ **Do**: Explain why each edit improves content

❌ **Don't**: Edit every section
✅ **Do**: Focus on high-impact changes only

❌ **Don't**: Suggest edits to technical/code sections unless critical
✅ **Do**: Preserve technical accuracy

❌ **Don't**: Override user voice completely
✅ **Do**: Enhance while respecting existing style

❌ **Don't**: Provide vague rationale ("makes it better")
✅ **Do**: Be specific ("adds hook by leading with pain point")

### Quality Checklist

Before outputting suggestions, verify:

- [ ] Each suggestion has all required fields (section_name, type, rationale, before, after)
- [ ] Rationale is specific and actionable
- [ ] Before content is exact match from source
- [ ] After content maintains factual accuracy
- [ ] Section types are correctly classified
- [ ] Technical sections are preserved or have compelling reason for edit
- [ ] Total suggestions limited to high-impact changes (5-10)
- [ ] Output format matches standard template
- [ ] No file writing occurs

## Example suggest_edits Flow

### Input Content

```markdown
# How to Optimize Database Queries

Database optimization is important for application performance.

## Query Analysis

You should analyze your queries to find slow ones. Use EXPLAIN to see what the database is doing.

```sql
EXPLAIN SELECT * FROM users WHERE email = 'test@example.com';
```

This shows you the execution plan.

## Takeaway

Optimizing queries makes your app faster.
```

### Skill Processing (Mad Men Copywriter Example)

**Section Classification**:
- Title: `introduction` (candidate for hook improvement)
- "Database optimization is important...": `introduction` (weak hook, conversion candidate)
- "Query Analysis": `concept-explanation` (could strengthen value)
- Code block: `technical` (preserve as-is)
- "This shows you...": `concept-explanation` (could add impact)
- "Takeaway": `takeaway` (weak, conversion candidate)

**Edit Suggestions Generated**: 3 (introduction hook, concept value, takeaway CTA)

### Output

```markdown
# Edit Suggestions for "How to Optimize Database Queries"

Generated by: Mad Men Copywriter
Date: 2025-01-15

---

## Summary

**Total Suggestions**: 3
**Editable Sections Found**: 5
**Sections Preserved**: 2

**Focus Areas**:
- Strengthen introduction hook with pain-first approach
- Add conversion value to query analysis section
- Transform weak takeaway into action-driving CTA

---

## Suggested Edit 1: Introduction Hook

**Type**: introduction
**Rationale**: Current opening is generic and doesn't hook reader. Lead with pain point to grab attention immediately. Adds urgency and stakes to create desire to read on.

### Before
```
Database optimization is important for application performance.
```

### After
```
Your users are waiting 3 seconds for a page that should load in 300ms. Every extra second costs you 7% conversion. The culprit? Unoptimized database queries silently killing your revenue.
```

### Apply This Edit?
- [ ] Yes, apply as-is
- [ ] Apply with modifications
- [ ] Skip this edit

---

## Suggested Edit 2: Query Analysis Value

**Type**: concept-explanation
**Rationale**: Current explanation is procedural ("should analyze") without selling the value. Add specific benefit (what you'll discover) to create desire to use EXPLAIN.

### Before
```
You should analyze your queries to find slow ones. Use EXPLAIN to see what the database is doing.
```

### After
```
EXPLAIN reveals exactly where your query is bleeding performance - table scans instead of index hits, unnecessary joins, missing indexes. Five minutes of analysis can turn a 3-second query into 50ms.
```

### Apply This Edit?
- [ ] Yes, apply as-is
- [ ] Apply with modifications
- [ ] Skip this edit

---

## Suggested Edit 3: Takeaway to CTA

**Type**: takeaway
**Rationale**: Generic conclusion doesn't drive action. Convert to specific CTA that tells reader exactly what to do next, creating urgency around implementation.

### Before
```
Optimizing queries makes your app faster.
```

### After
```
Stop losing users to slow queries. Run EXPLAIN on your three slowest endpoints today. Fix the worst offender before lunch. Your conversion rate will thank you.
```

### Apply This Edit?
- [ ] Yes, apply as-is
- [ ] Apply with modifications
- [ ] Skip this edit

---

## Sections Intentionally Preserved

The following sections were **not** edited to maintain technical accuracy:

- **SQL Code Block** (technical): Code examples must remain exact for correctness
- **"This shows you the execution plan"** (technical): Factual explanation, no conversion value to add

---

## Application Notes

1. **Review rationale** for each suggestion before applying
2. **Test technical sections** if modified (should be rare)
3. **Maintain your voice** - modify suggestions to match your style
4. **Apply selectively** - not all suggestions may fit your intent

## Next Steps

- [ ] Review all suggested edits
- [ ] Apply selected edits to source file
- [ ] Re-read for consistency after applying
- [ ] Verify technical accuracy if code/config sections touched
```

## Integration with Copywriting Skills

The suggest_edits framework is used by all copywriting skills:

### Skill-Specific Applications

| Skill | Focus | Typical Edit Count | Primary Section Types |
|-------|-------|-------------------|---------------------|
| **Mad Men Copywriter** | Conversion | 5-8 | introduction, cta, concept-explanation |
| **Master Copywriter** | Persuasion | 6-10 | introduction, concept-explanation, takeaway |
| **Ameno Voice** | Simplification | 4-7 | concept-explanation, failure-mode, takeaway |

### Skill Differentiation in Suggestions

**Same section, different skills**:

**Original**: "This feature helps you manage user permissions."

**Mad Men**: "Control exactly who sees what. One click prevents unauthorized access disasters."
- Rationale: Conversion-focused, pain prevention, action-oriented

**Master Copywriter**: "Granular permission controls give you the authority to scale securely, backed by enterprise-grade access management trusted by Fortune 500 teams."
- Rationale: Persuasion through authority signals and social proof

**Ameno Voice**: "Permission management lets you set who can access what - like a bouncer list for your app's features."
- Rationale: Simplification through analogy, friendly but direct

## Workflow Integration

### Where suggest_edits Fits in Content Creation

```
1. Create Draft (Direct Voice)
   ↓
2. Review for Accuracy
   ↓
3. [OPTIONAL] Run Copywriting Skill
   ↓ (generates suggestions)
4. Review Suggestions
   ↓
5. Selectively Apply Edits
   ↓
6. Final Review
   ↓
7. Publish
```

**Key**: Steps 3-5 are optional and strategic. Not all content needs copywriting enhancement.

### When to Use suggest_edits Skills

**Use when**:
- Content lacks engagement (introduction, CTAs)
- Conversion is a goal (landing pages, sales copy)
- Persuasion needed (thought leadership, trust building)
- Technical content needs simplification (complex concepts)

**Skip when**:
- Pure technical documentation
- Content is already optimized
- Factual/formal tone required
- Code examples, configuration files

## Extending the Framework

### Creating a New Copywriting Skill

To create a new skill using suggest_edits:

1. **Define VOICE_DNA**: Personality, tone, techniques, vocabulary
2. **Create SKILL.md**: Include suggest_edits implementation instructions
3. **Build EXAMPLES**: Before/after with rationale for each edit
4. **Document FRAMEWORKS**: Applicable copywriting/persuasion patterns
5. **Test output**: Verify no auto-modification, format compliance

### Framework Extension Points

Future enhancements could include:

- **Multi-skill suggestions**: Run multiple skills, compare suggestions
- **A/B variant generation**: Generate alternative suggestion versions
- **Metrics tracking**: Measure which edits improve engagement
- **Confidence scores**: Rate how certain skill is that edit will improve content
- **Batch processing**: Suggest edits across multiple files simultaneously

## Best Practices

### For Skill Users

1. **Run skill AFTER drafting** - Create content first, enhance second
2. **Review rationale carefully** - Understand why each edit is suggested
3. **Apply selectively** - Not all suggestions will fit your intent
4. **Modify suggestions** - Adapt to your voice and context
5. **Re-read after applying** - Ensure consistency and flow
6. **Verify technical accuracy** - If code/config touched, test it

### For Skill Creators

1. **Limit suggestions** - Quality over quantity (5-10 per document)
2. **Be specific in rationale** - "Adds pain hook" > "Makes it better"
3. **Preserve technical sections** - Code accuracy > style
4. **Classify sections accurately** - Proper type ensures appropriate edits
5. **Test on diverse content** - Validate skill across content types
6. **Follow output format** - Consistency enables tooling

## Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

**Issue**: Skill suggests too many edits
**Solution**: Increase selectivity - focus on highest-impact changes only

**Issue**: Suggestions don't match skill philosophy
**Solution**: Review VOICE_DNA and ensure transformation logic aligns

**Issue**: User applies edits that break technical accuracy
**Solution**: Add warnings in rationale when edits touch technical content

**Issue**: Output format inconsistent across skills
**Solution**: Validate against standard template in skill tests

**Issue**: Rationale too vague to be useful
**Solution**: Require specific copywriting principle in each rationale (e.g., "Uses AIDA framework to create desire")

## Summary

The suggest_edits framework empowers strategic copywriting while preserving editorial control. By generating suggestions instead of auto-applying changes, users maintain ownership of their content while benefiting from specialized copywriting expertise.

**Core contract**:
- Skills **suggest**, never modify
- Every edit includes **why**, not just **what**
- Users **decide** which edits align with their intent
- Technical accuracy is **never compromised**

This pattern scales across multiple copywriting personalities (Mad Men, Master Copywriter, Ameno Voice) while maintaining consistency and quality.
