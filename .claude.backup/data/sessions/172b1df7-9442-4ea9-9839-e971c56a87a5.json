    "rehype-mermaid sounds good. Let's migrate every single ascii art design to a mermaid chart. Also, this activity is a skill that we can use within agents. review @/ai_docs/anthropic_skills.md and create a new skill. Then use that skill to migrate all ascii art",
    "This is not simply an Create ASCII-to-Mermaid skill but a skill to create mermaid diagrams from prompts (or whatever input skills require)",
