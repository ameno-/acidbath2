IDEAS

- Prompts are the fundamental unit of engineering in the age of agents.
- Well-crafted prompts can generate hundreds of hours of productive work efficiently.
- Bad prompts compound failure at the same exponential rate as good ones.
- Engineers must shift mindset to create prompts for three audiences: you, team, agents.
- Winners build libraries of reusable battle-tested agentic prompts with composable sections.
- Composable prompt sections work like Lego blocks that can be swapped interchangeably.
- Agentic prompt engineering allows prompts to call hundreds of tool calls automatically.
- Modern prompts can run for minutes to hours with extensive capabilities.
- Seven powerful agentic prompt formats exist with specific composable sections underneath.
- Workflow prompts represent sequential workflows and are the most important format.
- Metadata sections provide tool specifications but offer limited overall prompt value.
- Report sections control agent response format including JSON, YAML, and structure.
- Variables make prompts massively more valuable by enabling dynamic information passing.
- Dynamic variables change based on input while static variables remain constant.
- Context maps help agents navigate codebases faster without additional tool calls.
- Input-workflow-output represents a consistent three-step pattern for prompt design thinking.
- Control flow prompts add conditions, loops, and early returns to workflow.
- Delegation prompts kick off other agents to accomplish distributed computational work.
- Nondeterministic agents return different results when multiple instances run simultaneously.
- Primary agents act as prompt engineers for sub-agents in delegation scenarios.
- Background prompts enable autonomous agent operation while engineers continue other work.
- Template meta prompts represent the highest tier of agentic engineering velocity.
- Ninety percent of engineering needs can be met with seven prompt levels.
- Workflow sections are the most important component of any agentic prompt.
- Communication quality to agents directly impacts the results they can deliver.
- Consistent prompt formats enable CRUD operations on prompts at light speed.
- Engineering must consider the stakeholder trifecta: you, your team, and agents.
- Consistency beats complexity when designing reusable agentic prompt systems consistently.
- Agents represent a new type of consumer requiring specific prompt design.
- Swappable Lego blocks enable distinct uses and capabilities for repeat success.
- Asymmetric engineering becomes possible when investing in prompts for the trifecta.
- Context engineering importance ranks below fundamental prompt engineering skills and knowledge.
- Domain-specific customizable agents require mastery of specialized prompt engineering techniques.
- Scaling requires moving beyond simple back-and-forth prompting toward automated pipelines.
- Pipeline systems should do one thing extraordinarily well rather than many.
- Starting with ad hoc prompts allows natural progression to more complex formats.
- Template meta prompts enable prompts that build prompts and agents building.
