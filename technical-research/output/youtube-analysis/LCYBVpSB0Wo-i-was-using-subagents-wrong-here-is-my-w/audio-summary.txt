Analysis complete for "I was using sub-agents wrong... Here is my way after 20+ hrs test". Quality score: 78 out of 100, high priority. Key insight: Sub-agents should be specialized researchers, not implementers. Use file-based context management to prevent token bloat and share information across agents. Recommended action: Design agents per service provider and have them output implementation plans for parent agents to execute.
