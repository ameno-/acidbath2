- "This back and forth in the loop prompting is just the beginning of what's possible."
- "We are engineers so we can build out and leverage this technology better than anyone."
- "It is so funny that prompt engineering is the most important skill any engineer can have now."
- "I can guarantee you right now the models, the agents, they are no longer the bottleneck, okay? It's now a complete skill issue."
- "Think about the advantage you gain by using the right compute in the right agent architecture like the agentic drop zone."
- "We're going to be working to step outside the chat box. Think about all the repeat engineering work you do."
- "No matter what you do, stay focused and keep building."
