## Style 1: Glass Object Technical

### Description
Photorealistic glass or crystal rendering of technical objects (cameras, servers, circuits, architectural components). Emphasizes transparency, light refraction, and material luxury to represent sophisticated technical architecture.

### Best Use Cases
- **Content Types**: Architecture posts, framework explanations, system design, technical foundations
- **Topics**: Agent systems, SDK architecture, platform design, infrastructure
- **Examples**: "The Agent Endgame", API architecture posts, framework deep-dives

### Nano Banana Prompt Template

```
A photorealistic, highly detailed image featuring [TECHNICAL_OBJECT] rendered in clear, highly polished transparent glass or crystal material. [The object has distinct thickness and dimensional depth, with the iconic shape of [OBJECT_DESCRIPTION]—presenting key structural elements in simplified yet extremely precise geometric structures, making it instantly recognizable without any patterns]. All edges are treated with rounded chamfers and smooth curved surfaces, creating elegant refraction effects under light. The object is placed slightly tilted, as if floating above a clean, flawless, seamless pale beige or very light gray studio background.

Lighting is bright, clean professional studio light, focusing on highlighting the transparency, specular reflection and refraction characteristics of the glass material. Sharp and delicate highlights appear on the object's chamfers, edges and key structural components, highlighting the crystal texture and luxurious vision. Subtle refraction, light bending and local distortion effects are produced when light penetrates the interior of the glass body, especially obvious in thickness variation areas and internal component details, greatly enhancing realism and visual impact. A soft, diffuse shadow falls below and slightly behind the object, giving the picture a sense of groundedness without destroying the minimalist temperament.

The overall aesthetic style is minimalist, modern, and clean, presenting the visual effect of high-end product photography and concept art rendering. The focus of the picture is completely on the crystal clear material performance and precise geometric shape of the glass [TECHNICAL_OBJECT]. The image as a whole is high-key and shallow depth of field processing, keeping the object in absolute sharp focus, while the background is softly blurred, thereby maximizing the subject.

- **Examples**: "Prompts Are the New Code", "Chat UI Is Dead", disruptive perspective posts

### Nano Banana Prompt Template

```
A 1080x1080 pixel close-up photo composition, hands holding a white newspaper, shot downwards from above. The background is extremely blurred and dark (deep charcoal or black), making the newspaper stand out clearly with dramatic contrast. The newspaper occupies 70-80% of the picture, and its content is sharp and legible.

The hands are positioned naturally holding the newspaper from the sides, showing partial foreground presence. Hands are slightly out of focus compared to the newspaper text, maintaining emphasis on content. Skin tone is [SKIN_TONE] with natural lighting revealing hand texture and detail.

The eye-catching headline dominates the top of the newspaper in bold, large typography:
"[HEADLINE]"

The headline uses [HEADLINE_STYLE] typeface (examples: "bold serif newspaper font like Times New Roman or Bodoni", "strong sans-serif like Franklin Gothic or Helvetica Bold", "classic newspaper slab serif like Rockwell").

In the center of the picture is a large black and white photograph showing [PHOTO_DESCRIPTION]. The photograph is clearly visible and professionally composed, appearing as if it were printed in newspaper halftone dots. The image supports and amplifies the headline message.

Below the photograph, newspaper body copy is visible in multiple columns with [COLUMN_COUNT] columns of readable text. The layout follows traditional newspaper design with justified text, column rules, and professional typographic hierarchy. Text appears authentic and legible at the image's full resolution, though individual word reading is not critical.

Additional newspaper elements:
- Publication name/masthead: "[PUBLICATION_NAME]" in traditional newspaper header styling
- Date: [NEWSPAPER_DATE] positioned in standard location
- Subheadlines or pull quotes (optional): "[SUBHEADLINE]"
- Byline: "By [AUTHOR_NAME]" if specified

Lighting setup: Strong directional light from upper-left creates dramatic reading light effect. The light emphasizes the newspaper's whiteness and text clarity while creating natural shadows that add depth. The extremely blurred and dark background ensures total focus on the newspaper content. Depth of field is very shallow—hands slightly soft, newspaper in razor-sharp focus, background completely out of focus.

Photographic style: High-contrast, documentary aesthetic with professional color grading. Slight vignette darkening edges. The composition suggests urgency, importance, and breaking news. Shot with photojournalism style attention to realistic detail.

Technical specifications: Initially composed at 1080x1080 for social media, then cropped/adapted to 2560x1440 for blog header maintaining newspaper legibility and dramatic composition.

## Style 5: Enhanced Glitch Corruption

### Description
Upgraded version of the classic digital glitch art style with improved depth, material rendering, and spatial effects. Combines digital corruption aesthetics with holographic distortion and neon accents. Universal fallback style that works across all content types while maintaining backward compatibility.

### Best Use Cases
- **Content Types**: Universal—works for all post types when other styles don't fit
- **Topics**: Technology, AI, digital transformation, any technical subject
- **Examples**: Any post needing visual interest without specific style requirements

### Nano Banana Prompt Template

```
A digital glitch art composition featuring [SUBJECT_DESCRIPTION] with layered corruption effects and holographic distortion. The image uses a dark, tech-noir aesthetic with [PRIMARY_COLOR] neon accents against a deep black or very dark [BACKGROUND_COLOR] gradient background.

The primary subject [SUBJECT_PLACEMENT] shows [CORRUPTION_LEVEL] digital corruption:
- Scanline artifacts running horizontally across the image with varying intensity
- RGB channel separation creating colored edge fringing (red/cyan or magenta/green shifts)
- Pixelation zones with distinct mosaic effects in [PIXELATION_AREAS]
- Datamoshing effects showing temporal compression artifacts
- Glitch displacement creating horizontal or vertical tears in the image

Holographic material effects:
The subject exhibits holographic foil properties with iridescent shimmer. Light creates rainbow spectral reflections across the surface, shifting between [COLOR_RANGE] (e.g., "cyan, magenta, and yellow", "purple, blue, and pink", "green, orange, and red"). The holographic texture is layered beneath and interwoven with the glitch corruption, creating depth where digital artifacts appear to float above a shimmering metallic base.

Spatial layering:
- **Foreground**: Sharp glitch elements, highest corruption intensity, bright neon accents
- **Midground**: Primary subject with moderate corruption and holographic shimmer
- **Background**: Deep atmospheric effects, gradient darkness, subtle particle systems

Lighting and effects:
- Neon glow emanating from corrupted edges and glitch artifacts
- Volumetric light rays or god rays cutting through the scene (optional)
- Chromatic aberration especially pronounced at image edges
- Subtle bloom and glow on bright elements creating cyberpunk atmosphere
- Depth fog or atmospheric haze in background layers

Technical corruption patterns:
- [GLITCH_TYPE_1]: (e.g., "horizontal scanline displacement", "vertical tearing", "block compression artifacts")
- [GLITCH_TYPE_2]: (e.g., "color banding", "digital noise clusters", "data corruption blocks")
- [GLITCH_TYPE_3]: (e.g., "wireframe overlay segments", "hexadecimal text fragments", "error code overlays")

Typography integration (optional):
Distorted text reading "[TEXT_OVERLAY]" appears partially corrupted with glitch effects, positioned at [TEXT_POSITION]. Text uses [FONT_STYLE] with heavy digital distortion.

Color palette:
- Primary: [PRIMARY_COLOR] (e.g., "cyan", "magenta", "neon green", "electric purple")
- Secondary: [SECONDARY_COLOR] for contrast and accents
- Background: Deep blacks with dark [BACKGROUND_COLOR] gradients
- Accents: Bright neon highlights and holographic rainbow shimmer

The overall composition balances recognizability of the subject with artistic corruption, ensuring the image reads clearly as a blog header while maintaining strong visual impact through glitch aesthetics.

Technical specifications: 2560x1440 resolution, 16:9 aspect ratio, optimized for blog header with sufficient corruption for visual interest without sacrificing clarity.
```

### Material Specifications
- **Base**: Digital/holographic with iridescent properties
- **Corruption**: Pixelated, scanlined, RGB-separated
- **Surface**: Layered depth—glitch artifacts float above base
- **Effects**: Neon glow, chromatic aberration, bloom

### Lighting Setup
- **Type**: Neon/cyberpunk lighting with strong color accents
- **Direction**: Variable—often front-lit with edge lighting
- **Effects**: Glow, bloom, volumetric rays (optional), atmospheric haze
- **Atmosphere**: Tech-noir, cyberpunk, digital dystopia

### Composition Rules
- **Layering**: Distinct foreground/midground/background separation
- **Subject Placement**: Center or rule-of-thirds, depending on subject
- **Corruption Balance**: Enough to be visually interesting, not so much it's illegible
- **Color Contrast**: Bright neons against deep darks for pop
- **Depth**: Use fog, blur, and layering to create spatial depth

### Placeholder Variables
- `[SUBJECT_DESCRIPTION]`: What the image depicts (e.g., "abstract AI neural network visualization", "corrupted terminal interface", "glitching code editor window")
- `[PRIMARY_COLOR]`: Main neon accent color
- `[BACKGROUND_COLOR]`: Dark gradient base color
- `[SUBJECT_PLACEMENT]`: Where subject sits (e.g., "centered in frame", "offset to left third", "filling most of the frame")
- `[CORRUPTION_LEVEL]`: Intensity (e.g., "moderate", "heavy", "subtle")
- `[PIXELATION_AREAS]`: Where mosaic effects appear
- `[COLOR_RANGE]`: Holographic color spectrum
- `[GLITCH_TYPE_1/2/3]`: Specific glitch effects to include
- `[TEXT_OVERLAY]`: Optional corrupted text
- `[TEXT_POSITION]`: Where text appears
- `[FONT_STYLE]`: Typography choice for overlay text
- `[SECONDARY_COLOR]`: Contrasting accent color

### Technical Notes
- This style is the most forgiving—works when content mapping is unclear
- Balance corruption with legibility—blog headers must still communicate
- Holographic layer adds sophistication over basic glitch art
- Spatial depth prevents flat, dated glitch aesthetics
- Neon colors should complement post theme when possible (e.g., red/orange for performance issues, cyan/blue for architecture, purple/magenta for creative/opinion)

## Prompt Composition Guidance

### Filling Template Placeholders

1. **Analyze Post Content**: Extract key concepts, technical objects, metaphors, and tone
2. **Identify Placeholder Variables**: Each template has `[PLACEHOLDER]` markers
3. **Map Content to Placeholders**: Match extracted concepts to appropriate variables
4. **Maintain Template Structure**: Keep all non-placeholder text intact
5. **Verify Completeness**: Ensure no unfilled placeholders remain before generation

### Mixing Base Styles with Content-Specific Elements

Templates are designed to be modular. You can:
- **Add Subject-Specific Details**: Enhance placeholders with post-specific language
- **Adjust Color Palettes**: Match colors to post theme or brand
- **Modify Composition**: Tweak placement and framing for specific content needs
- **Layer Multiple Effects**: Combine elements from different templates when appropriate

Example: A post about "AI agent cost optimization" could use:
- **Base Style**: Technical Blueprint (performance-focused)
- **Color Modification**: Red/orange accents instead of cyan (cost = warning)
- **Subject Addition**: Include dollar signs or cost metrics in annotations
- **Composition Tweak**: Title block shows cost savings comparison

### Smart Defaults for Common Placeholders

When content analysis doesn't provide clear values:

- **Technical Objects**: Default to abstract geometric representations (cubes, spheres, networks)
- **Colors**: Use brand colors or neutral technical palette (cyan, white, gray)
- **Backgrounds**: Stick to template defaults (they're already optimized)
- **Typography**: Use template-recommended fonts (they match the style aesthetic)
- **Measurements/Metrics**: Use placeholder values like "X% improvement" or "N ms latency" if real data unavailable

### Validation Checklist Before Generation

- [ ] All `[PLACEHOLDER]` variables filled with specific content
- [ ] Color choices complement each other (no clashing)
- [ ] Technical specifications included (2560x1440, 16:9 aspect ratio)
- [ ] Subject description is clear and detailed enough for recognition
- [ ] Composition rules followed (placement, depth, focus)
- [ ] Lighting setup specified completely
- [ ] Material properties defined
- [ ] No contradictory instructions (e.g., "shallow depth of field" + "everything in focus")

## Troubleshooting Common Nano Banana Generation Issues

### Issue: Subject Not Recognizable
**Symptoms**: Generated image is abstract blob, unclear what object is supposed to be
**Solutions**:
- Add more geometric detail to `[OBJECT_DESCRIPTION]` placeholders
- Specify key identifying features explicitly (e.g., "rectangular body with circular lens in center")
- Use comparative language ("shaped like X but with Y features")
- Simplify—fewer complex features often render more clearly than many subtle ones

### Issue: Colors Look Muddy or Washed Out
**Symptoms**: Low contrast, colors blend together, lacks visual punch
**Solutions**:
- Increase color separation (brighter accents against darker backgrounds)
- Specify "high contrast" or "vivid saturation" in prompt
- Use complementary colors (blue/orange, purple/yellow, red/cyan)
- Add specular highlights or glowing accents to increase tonal range

### Issue: Composition Feels Flat or Boring
**Symptoms**: No depth, everything on same plane, lacks spatial interest
**Solutions**:
- Explicitly define foreground/midground/background layers
- Add depth-of-field instructions (what's sharp vs. blurred)
- Include shadows, reflections, or other depth cues
- Specify camera angle or viewing perspective
- Add atmospheric haze or fog in background layers

### Issue: Too Much Detail, Overwhelming Clutter
**Symptoms**: Image is busy, hard to focus, confusing for blog header use
**Solutions**:
- Reduce number of elements in composition
- Emphasize "minimalist" or "clean" aesthetic in prompt
- Use more negative space and simpler backgrounds
- Focus lighting on primary subject, darken secondary elements
- Simplify geometric forms—fewer complex shapes

### Issue: Lighting Doesn't Match Style Intent
**Symptoms**: Wrong mood, technical piece looks dramatic, opinion piece looks clinical
**Solutions**:
- Match lighting to content emotion: clean/bright for technical, dramatic/directional for provocative
- Specify light source position and intensity explicitly
- Add or remove shadow intensity
- Adjust background brightness (dark = dramatic, light = clean/professional)
- Include atmospheric effects (god rays, volumetric fog, glow) for mood

### Issue: Text/Typography Unreadable
**Symptoms**: Blurry text, wrong font, poor placement, illegible at blog header size
**Solutions**:
- Specify exact font names (not just "bold" or "serif")
- Increase text size in composition ("large", "dominant", "60% of newspaper area")
- Ensure high contrast between text and background
- Request "sharp focus on text" or "legible at full resolution"
- Simplify text content—fewer words render more clearly

### Issue: Style Doesn't Match Content Tone
**Symptoms**: Serious technical post gets playful style, opinion piece looks too clinical
**Solutions**:
- Review style selection—may need different base template
- Adjust color palette to match emotional tone
- Modify lighting (bright = approachable, dark/dramatic = serious/provocative)
- Change material properties (glass = sophisticated, glitch = edgy, blueprint = rigorous)
- Consider newspaper style for controversial takes, blueprint for data-driven

### Issue: Generation Takes Too Long or Fails
**Symptoms**: Timeout errors, MCP server unresponsive, generation aborted
**Solutions**:
- Simplify prompt—remove optional details
- Reduce resolution temporarily for testing (can upscale later)
- Check MCP server status and restart if needed
- Break complex prompts into multiple attempts (generate base, then add effects)
- Use more common/standard artistic references (Nano Banana may have better training on certain styles)

## Advanced Techniques

### Progressive Disclosure in Prompts
Start with core subject and composition, then layer in material, lighting, and effects. This structure helps Nano Banana prioritize what matters most:

1. **Foundation**: Subject + placement + basic composition
2. **Material Layer**: Surface properties, textures, transparency
3. **Lighting Layer**: Light sources, shadows, atmospheric effects
4. **Detail Layer**: Annotations, fine details, special effects
5. **Technical Specs**: Resolution, aspect ratio, quality parameters

### Conditional Complexity
Match prompt complexity to content importance:
- **High-stakes posts** (major launches, controversial takes): Use full template with all optional details
- **Standard posts** (regular blog content): Use core template, skip optional flourishes
- **Quick posts** (updates, minor content): Simplify to essential placeholders only

### Style Mixing
When appropriate, combine elements from multiple templates:
- **Base structure** from one style (e.g., Isometric layout)
- **Material properties** from another (e.g., Glass rendering)
- **Lighting/atmosphere** from a third (e.g., Blueprint's technical precision)

Only mix when you have clear rationale—random mixing degrades quality.

### Iterative Refinement
If first generation is close but not perfect:
1. Identify specific issue (refer to Troubleshooting section)
2. Modify only the relevant prompt section
3. Keep successful elements unchanged
4. Regenerate with refined prompt
5. Repeat until satisfied

Don't start from scratch—preserve what works.
