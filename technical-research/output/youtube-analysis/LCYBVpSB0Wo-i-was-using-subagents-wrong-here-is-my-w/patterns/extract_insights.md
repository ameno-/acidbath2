# INSIGHTS

• Sub-agents work best as researchers, not implementers
• Context engineering saves more tokens than actual implementation
• File system becomes ultimate context management across agents
• Specialized agents need domain-specific documentation embedded deeply
• Parent agents lose implementation context without proper sharing
• Research phases dramatically improve final coding output quality
• Token optimization matters more than execution speed initially
• Documentation retrieval beats conversation history for persistence
• Agent orchestration requires explicit context file maintenance
• Implementation delegation fails without proper information architecture
revents premature implementation and debugging chaos
