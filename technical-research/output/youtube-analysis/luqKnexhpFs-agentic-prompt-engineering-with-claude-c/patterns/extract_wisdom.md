# SUMMARY

Engineering expert explains seven levels of agentic prompt formats with composable sections for creating reusable, powerful prompts that maximize engineering impact through agents.

# IDEAS

- Prompts are now the fundamental unit of engineering in the age of agents and automation.
- Every prompt becomes a force multiplier that can generate hundreds of hours of productive work.
- Bad prompts compound failure at the same rate as good prompts compound success exponentially.
- Engineers must now create prompts for three audiences: themselves, their team, and their agents.
- The stakeholder trifecta for agents includes you, your team, and your agents as consumers.
- Winners build libraries of reusable battle-tested agentic prompts with composable Lego-like sections.
- Workflow prompts represent sequential workflows and are the most important agentic prompt format available.
- The workflow section is the most useful section across all prompt formats and levels.
- Metadata sections provide tool specifications but offer limited value compared to other prompt components.
- Report sections control agent output format including JSON, YAML, or specific structured responses.
- Variables make prompts massively more valuable by enabling dynamic and static information passing.
- Static variables remain constant while dynamic variables change based on input arguments provided.
- Control flow prompts add conditions, loops, and early returns to basic workflow functionality.
- Natural language can effectively request loops and conditional logic within agentic prompt structures.
- Delegation prompts kick off other agents to accomplish work through distributed computing approaches.
- Multiple agents return different nondeterministic results when given the same task to complete.
- Primary agents become prompt engineers for sub-agents in delegation scenarios and workflows.
- Background prompts enable autonomous agent operation while engineers continue other productive work.
- Template meta prompts represent the highest level where prompts build other prompts automatically.
- Input-workflow-output represents a consistent three-step pattern for designing effective agentic prompts.
- Consistency beats complexity in prompt engineering for you, your team, and your agents.
- Great prompting equals great communicating across all stakeholders in the engineering trifecta.
- Confusion reduction should be the primary goal when designing prompts for multiple audiences.
- Swappable sections allow engineers to use only necessary components in their prompt designs.
- Context engineering uses R&D framework where D represents delegation to other computational agents.

# QUOTES

- "The prompt is now the fundamental unit of engineering. And with agents, every prompt you create becomes a force multiplier."
- "One well-crafted prompt can generate tens and hundreds of hours of productive work. One bad prompt compounds failure at the same rate."
- "We're now engineering for three audiences. You, your team, and your agents. This is the stakeholder trifecta for the age of agents."
- "The winners here are building libraries of reusable battle tested agentic prompts with composable sections that work like Lego blocks."
- "Great prompting is great communicating."
- "Consistency is the greatest weapon against confusion for both you and your agent."
- "If I handed this to a co-worker, could they complete this work top to bottom? If that's true, you've probably written a high quality prompt."
- "Consistency beats complexity. Consistency makes you faster, makes your team faster. And it makes your agents faster when you find the working formula."
- "We are specifically saying, we're talking to our primary agent. We're saying design agent prompts."
- "This is the future of engineering. Once you build up great agents that perform for you and get work done, the next question is how many agents can you spin up?"
- "Consistency is king when it comes to writing great agentic prompts."
- "The prompt is the fundamental unit of engineering. Invest in your prompts for the trifecta to achieve asymmetric engineering in the age of agents."
- "Engineering is not just about your agents. It's not just about you. It's not just about your team. You need to hit the trifecta."
- "Your agents will be able to reason about many different prompt structures, but engineering is not just about your agents."
- "Context engineering is very important, but your prompts kick off and dictate everything you do."

# HABITS

- Always collapse prompts to second level to quickly see all composable sections consistently.
- Use consistent three-step pattern of input-workflow-output for all prompt design and development.
- Start with lowest level prompts and scale up capabilities only when additional complexity needed.
- Reference variables throughout prompts using consistent syntax patterns for clarity and maintainability.
- Write direct, dry language when communicating with agents rather than conversational or flowery language.
- Test prompts thoroughly to understand exactly what they will do before deploying them.
- Create static variables for information that doesn't change to reduce repetition throughout prompts.
- Use numbered lists for workflows and bullet points for auxiliary information and instructions.
- Grade prompt sections by usefulness and difficulty to understand their value and complexity.
- Build libraries of reusable prompts rather than writing new ones from scratch repeatedly.
- Focus on reducing confusion as the primary goal when designing prompts for multiple audiences.
- Use metadata sections only when specific tool or model constraints need to be specified.
- Implement early returns and conditional logic to handle edge cases and missing information.
- Design prompts as if handing them to coworkers who need to complete work independently.
- Maintain consistent prompt formats across all engineering work to reduce cognitive overhead significantly.

# FACTS
