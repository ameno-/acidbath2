Based on this video transcript about Claude Code sub-agents, here are the key recommendations:

- Consider each sub-agent as a researcher rather than implementation executor
- Use sub-agents for planning and research, not direct code implementation
- Create specialized sub-agents for each service provider (Vercel, Supabase, Tailwind, etc.)
- Include relevant documentation directly in sub-agent system prompts
- Equip sub-agents with specific MCP tools for information retrieval
- Use file system as ultimate context management system
- Save tool results to local files instead of conversation history
- Create task folders to contain context for each feature
- Always create context files that include project information
- Have sub-agents read context files before starting work
- Update context files after completing tasks
- Use identical output formats and rules across all sub-agents
- Prevent sub-agents from calling themselves or getting confused
- Pass context file names when delegating tasks to sub-agents
- Focus on token optimization through context engineering
- Create detailed implementation plans rather than direct code changes
- Use parent agents for orchestration and actual implementation
- Maintain project plans in doc/task/context sessions files
- Delegate research work to specialized agents with domain expertise
- Test sub-agents in production environments before widespread use
