    "Jerry, this new feature doesn't appear to be documented anywhere in GitHub or GitLab. That is fine if it is not documented as an issue but we must make sure that a spec file is created. Where is this branch being pushed to? ",
    "ok, Im about ready to merge. Lets pull main in and give me the adw command to run this workflow for all current issues/prs. Re-running a review shouldn't be a problem. The review flow should be clever enough to skip a review if no new commits have been pushed",
    "What will happen now if I trigger a review on issues and branches that have already been reviewed? ",
    "Yes, let's implement that and do a quick test. Make sure to update the spec and related documentation",
    "go",
    "open this worktree in code",
    "Why would there be a rate-limit? We shouldn't be using an API key. Can you review this branch and other branches and merge main back into this branch, this issue shouldn't be ocurring. Determine where the fix was made and make sure its fully resolved"
