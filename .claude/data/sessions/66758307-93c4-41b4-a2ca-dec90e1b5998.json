    "/commit sdlc_planner bug {\"number\": \"21\", \"title\": \"Gitlab comments not posting\", \"body\": \"bug\\n\\nPosting comments to gitlab from workflows does not work. It appears that the issue related to the other issue that was fixed #14. Fundamentally this application is configured to run with multiple Git remotes. The GitLab remote is considered a mirror. Eventually we will be able to consume issues from Linear as well. This abstraction is absolutely critical. When posting comments to GitHub or GitLab should not have to prefix the workflow command with the type of repository being used. Rather we should look at the existing remotes for the Git repositories that have been configured and use the remotes that are configured inside of that repository to check if the issue is in GitHub or GitLab. Things more dynamic and reliable. And eventually when we have another source to add, we'll check if the issue is in Linear. While it is helpful to prefix with GitLab to avoid any sort of conflicts with issue numbers. We must allow that to be optional. We must allow it to be optional for me to write out the GitLab project name in addition to the service that's being used. That should already be configured inside of the repo. \\n\\nRelated issue with gitlab integration: https://github.com/ameno-/jerry/issues/14#issue-3701184606\"}"
