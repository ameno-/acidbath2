# RECOMMENDATIONS

- Create prompts for three audiences: you, your team, and your agents
- Build libraries of reusable, battle-tested agentic prompts with composable sections
- Use consistent prompt formats with swappable Lego-block sections across all prompts
- Structure prompts with three core components: input, workflow, and output
- Write workflows as sequential, step-by-step tasks for agents to execute
- Include metadata sections to specify tools, models, and execution parameters
- Add report sections to control agent output format and structure
- Use variables (both static and dynamic) to make prompts reusable
- Reference variables consistently throughout prompts using clear syntax patterns
- Implement control flow with conditions, loops, and early returns when needed
- Add instruction sections for auxiliary information supporting the workflow
- Include context maps to help agents navigate codebases more efficiently
- Use direct, dry language when communicating with agents in prompts
- Collapse prompts to second level to quickly analyze composable sections
- Only include sections you actually need; remove unnecessary complexity
- Test prompts thoroughly to ensure predictable agent behavior
- Start with simple ad-hoc prompts, then scale to workflow prompts
- Focus 90% of effort on perfecting the workflow section
- Push skills to at least B-tier level for most prompt engineering value
- Progress toward template meta prompts for maximum engineering velocity
