- Use semantic search tools like Serena instead of basic text search for AI coding
- Install MCP servers that provide intelligent code navigation and editing capabilities
- Choose language-specific refactoring tools rather than generic text-based approaches
- Run unit tests after every AI-assisted refactoring to verify correctness
- Use embedding-based searches to reduce token consumption in large codebases
- Avoid brute force approaches that cause AI agents to doom loop
- Install Roslyn-based tools for C# refactoring tasks when available
- Configure AI assistants to use specialized MCP servers in system prompts
- Look for open-source semantic code retrieval tools for your programming language
- Prioritize tools that reduce compile-fail-retry cycles in AI workflows
- Use factory method patterns when refactoring inheritance hierarchies
- Test drive new implementations after major code restructuring
- Push down class members to specific subclasses that actually use them
- Benchmark AI performance before and after adding specialized tools
- Consider autonomous refactoring for multi-step code transformation tasks
- Research GitHub for language-specific AI coding enhancement tools
- Use line counting tools to assess codebase complexity before refactoring
- Enable hands-off AI workflows for routine but complex refactoring tasks
- Measure token usage and cost when evaluating AI coding tool effectiveness
- Explore MCP servers before investing in expensive sub-agent approaches
