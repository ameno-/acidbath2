Based on the content about MCP server alternatives and context management for AI agents, here are the key recommendations:

- Use MCP servers for 80% of external tool integrations - simple and standardized
- Switch to CLI approach when you need specific control over external tools
- Implement scripts or skills only when context preservation is critical (5% of cases)
- Build CLI-first for new tools to enable you, team, and agent usage
- Use progressive disclosure to avoid loading unnecessary context into agents
- Wrap MCP servers around existing CLIs when scaling to multiple agents needed
- Prompt engineer context consumption before adding more complex solutions
- Focus agents on single purposes to sidestep most context engineering problems
- Read tool documentation files only when specific functionality is required
- Use self-contained single-file scripts with dependencies declared at the top
- Implement incremental context loading rather than front-loading all tool information
- Consider ecosystem lock-in when choosing between skills and portable CLI approaches
- Stack multiple approaches: start simple, add complexity only when necessary
- Test context window consumption with /context command to monitor token usage
- Build interoperability by having MCP server methods call into CLI functions
- Use UV for Python dependency management in single-file scripts
- Prime agents with specific prompts before giving them access to tools
- Avoid reinventing wheels - use existing MCP servers when they meet needs
- Monitor when multiple MCP servers consume 20%+ of context window capacity
- Delete focused agents after task completion to reset context consumption
