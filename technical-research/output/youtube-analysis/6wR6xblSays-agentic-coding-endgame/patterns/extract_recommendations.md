• Start with prompt engineering and context engineering for single agents before scaling
• Add more agents to scale compute and increase impact across your workflow
• Progress to custom agents when out-of-box solutions don't fit your specific codebase
• Build custom agents for your domain, problems, and edge cases specifically
• Focus on hard specific problems that most engineers can't solve out-of-box
• Master the system prompt as the most important element of custom agents
• Understand that system prompts affect every single user prompt your agent runs
• Use Cloud Code SDK to set up options, configure agents, and handle responses
• Track the core four elements: user prompts, agent responses, tool calls, results
• Choose appropriate models for your needs - use cheaper models for simple tasks
• Use query for one-off prompts and SDK client for continuous conversations
• Monitor what tools your agent has access to avoid unnecessary context consumption
• Consider appending to system prompts instead of completely overwriting them
• Build multi-agent systems for complex workflows like software development lifecycles
• Use out-of-box Cloud Code tools when you don't need to reinvent functionality
• Deploy agents across scripts, data streams, terminals, and user interfaces
• Focus on repeat workflows that benefit from agent automation
• Target high return on investment problems in your tools and business
• Find constraints in personal workflow and products to optimize with agents
• Teach agents to do work rather than just asking what they can do
