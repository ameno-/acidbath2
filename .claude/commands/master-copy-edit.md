# Master Copywriter Edit Command

Transform content into credibility-driven, persuasive copy using the Master Copywriter skill.

## Usage

```bash
/master-copy-edit {file_path}
```

**Example**:
```bash
/master-copy-edit content/thought-leadership/industry-trends.md
```

## What This Command Does

Analyzes content for persuasion opportunities and generates credibility-focused edit suggestions using Master Copywriter principles.

**Process**:
1. ✅ Reads the content file (never writes/modifies)
2. 🔍 Identifies credibility gaps (missing proof, weak authority)
3. 🎯 Analyzes for persuasion opportunities
4. ✏️ Generates edit suggestions with authority-building transformations
5. 📋 Outputs suggestions in suggest_edits format
6. ⛔ **Never modifies the original file**

## Focus Areas

### 1. Authority Establishment
**Looks for**: Unsupported claims, missing credentials

**Transforms to**: Research-backed assertions, expert credentials

**Example**:
```
❌ "Security is important"
✅ "We studied 2,000 breaches. 83% happened despite 'enterprise security.' Here's what actually works..."
```

### 2. Social Proof Integration
**Looks for**: Generic references, vague adoption claims

**Transforms to**: Specific companies, quantified adoption, testimonials

**Example**:
```
❌ "Many companies trust us"
✅ "1,247 companies including Stripe and Airbnb. Here's Stripe's CTO on why they chose us..."
```

### 3. Story-Driven Benefits
**Looks for**: Feature lists, dry explanations

**Transforms to**: Customer success narratives, before/after transformations

**Example**:
```
❌ "Real-time monitoring"
✅ "When Acme's site crashed Black Friday, they lost $2M in 4 hours. Since our platform: 3 years, zero downtime..."
```

### 4. Evidence-Based Claims
**Looks for**: Vague promises, unsubstantiated improvements

**Transforms to**: Quantified results, accessible proof

**Example**:
```
❌ "We'll improve conversion"
✅ "Last 127 clients: avg 34% improvement in 60 days. Median 28%. Here are 5 case studies..."
```
