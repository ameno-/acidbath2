    "We gotta add more style and grace to this website. The overall theme is pretty nice but the ASCII art is not good enough. We need a new header for AcidBath like the main page as well The code snippet previews also aren't good enough. There's too much horizontal scrolling Make sure that very long sections of blog posts that are many sections are able to be collapsed. For example the document generation skills blog post has massive sections and contains many sections with code. This just isn't good enough. We need to be able to collapse each one of those down. Let's work on a plan for each one of those steps but I'm going to guide you through the very first part because I have a lot of styling grace. Let's set up the Nano Banana MCP. https://github.com/ConechoAI/Nano-Banana-MCP",
