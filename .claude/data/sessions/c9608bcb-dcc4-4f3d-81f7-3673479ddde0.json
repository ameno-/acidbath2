    "I want to verify the implementation of ADWs. First, the directories must be relative. Next, the env variables must truly be local and not dependent on global env vars. I also want to make sure that I can add my own remotes for github and gitlab. The current implementation on main relies on github/gitlab cli access and not tokens. Can Jerry continue using the cli's for gitlab and github with just tokens? I must verify that all key workflows work. We can test by running workflows from this worktree using tokens. ",

Once that's done commit these changes using the /commit command, push the changes to the pull request, and update the spec file as needed. Once done we will run another validation flow to make sure that all the changes work "
