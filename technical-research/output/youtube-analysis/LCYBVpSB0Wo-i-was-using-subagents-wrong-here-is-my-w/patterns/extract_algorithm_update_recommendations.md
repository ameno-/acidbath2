Based on this content about Claude Code sub-agents and AI coding workflows, here are my algorithm update recommendations:

- When designing sub-agents, focus on research and planning rather than direct implementation tasks.

- Use file system as context management by saving research reports to local files instead of conversation history.

- Before executing any work, always read existing context files to understand the overall project state.
