## What This Site Covers

ACIDBATH provides deep technical content on building production AI systems:

- **Agentic AI Patterns**: Sub-agent architecture, workflow prompts, orchestration
- **Context Engineering**: Token optimization, progressive disclosure, semantic search
- **Claude Code**: Best practices, commands, custom agents, MCP integration
- **Production AI Economics**: Cost analysis, model routing, real-world benchmarks
