## Summary

**Editable Sections Found**: 6
**Sections Preserved**: 1

**Focus Areas**:
- Transform generic headline to pain-first hook
- Convert feature list to benefit-driven outcomes
- Strengthen weak CTA with specific value

## Suggested Edit 1: Headline Hook

**Type**: introduction

## Suggested Edit 2: Opening Value Proposition

**Type**: introduction
**Rationale**: Eliminates weak "excited to announce" company-focus. Applies value-by-word-50 principle to front-load benefit (visibility) instead of burying it. Creates FOMO through competitive framing.

### Before

## Suggested Edit 3: Features to Benefits Transformation

**Type**: concept-explanation

### Before
```
Our platform includes several powerful features:
- Real-time dashboards
- Custom report builder

## Suggested Edit 4: Weak Benefits to Concrete Value

**Type**: concept-explanation
**Rationale**: Replaces vague "better decisions" with quantified outcome (40% cost cut) and specific timeframe (30 days). Uses Before-After-Bridge structure to create tangible expectation.

### Before
```
Analytics can help you make better business decisions with data-driven insights.
```

### After
```
Know which marketing channel bleeds money by Friday. Cut ad spend 40% in 30 days. Keep the revenue.

## Suggested Edit 5: Generic CTA to Benefit-Driven Action

**Type**: cta
**Rationale**: Transforms generic "learn more" into specific benefit promise (savings calculation). Adds friction-reducing elements (free, instant). Creates urgency through "see your" personalization.
