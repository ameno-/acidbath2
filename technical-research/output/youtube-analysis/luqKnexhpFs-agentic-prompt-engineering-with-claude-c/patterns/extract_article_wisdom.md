# SUMMARY

Content by an AI engineering expert covering seven levels of agentic prompt engineering formats, from basic ad-hoc prompts to advanced template meta prompts, emphasizing the workflow section as the most critical component for engineering success.

# IDEAS

- The prompt has become the fundamental unit of engineering in the age of agents
- Every prompt you create becomes a force multiplier that can generate hundreds of hours of productive work
- Bad prompts compound failure at the same rate that good prompts multiply success
- Engineers must now design for three audiences: themselves, their team, and their agents
- This represents a stakeholder trifecta that most engineers haven't yet recognized or adapted to
- Winners are building libraries of reusable, battle-tested agentic prompts with composable sections
- These composable sections work like Lego blocks that can be swapped in and out as needed
- We've entered the era of agentic prompt engineering where prompts can call hundreds of tools
- Modern agentic prompts can run for minutes to hours, fundamentally changing their scope and power
- The workflow section is the most important and useful section of any agentic prompt
- Workflow prompts represent sequential workflows and are the most critical prompt format to master
- Variables make prompts massively more valuable by allowing dynamic and static information passing
- Dynamic variables change based on input, while static variables remain consistent throughout the prompt
- Great prompting is fundamentally about great communication to multiple stakeholders
- The three-step pattern of input, workflow, output provides a consistent framework for prompt design
- Control flow prompts enable conditions, loops, and early returns within agent workflows
- Natural language can effectively express complex programming concepts like loops and conditionals
- Delegation prompts allow agents to kick off other agents, multiplying computational power
- Agent delegation involves writing prompts that write prompts, creating recursive engineering capabilities
- Consistency beats complexity when designing reusable agentic prompt systems
- Template meta prompts represent the highest level of agentic engineering, enabling prompt generation
- The workflow section should contain a step-by-step play of exactly what you want your agent to execute
- Instructions sections provide auxiliary information that aids the workflow without being part of the main sequence
- Context maps help agents understand codebase structure without requiring file reads
- Metadata sections allow specification of exact tools, models, and constraints for agent execution
- Report sections control output format and structure, acting as the output specification layer
- XML blocks can add additional structure to communicate loop boundaries and control flow
- Static variables save significant time by allowing single-point updates throughout complex prompts
- Positional arguments enable flexible prompt interfaces that work with command-line tools
- Early returns and conditional exits prevent agents from proceeding with insufficient information
- Multiple agents working on the same task return different results due to their non-deterministic nature
- Primary agents can act as prompt engineers for sub-agents in delegation scenarios
- Background prompts enable autonomous agent operation while engineers continue other work
- Most engineering value comes from mastering B-tier level prompt engineering skills
- Ninety percent of engineering needs can be met with the seven levels of agentic prompt formats
- The key to scaling agentic engineering is templating the engineering process itself
- Consistent prompt formats reduce confusion for engineers, teams, and agents simultaneously
- Swappable sections should only be included when needed, avoiding unnecessary complexity
- Information-dense keywords have more value to agents and language models than verbose descriptions
- Prompts should be designed so any co-worker could complete the work top to bottom
- Context engineering and prompt engineering work together but prompts dictate everything that follows
- The future of engineering involves scaling hard and fast through agent pipeline construction
- Engineers need to transition from simple back-and-forth prompting to building specialized agent systems

# QUOTES

- "Great prompting is great communicating."
- "Consistency is the greatest weapon against confusion for both you and your agent."
- "If I handed this to a co-worker, could they complete this work top to bottom?"
- "Don't change the prompt format every single time."
- "Only add what you need, right? These are composable pieces of your agentic prompts."

- "Consistency is king when it comes to writing great agentic prompts."
- "The prompt is the fundamental unit of engineering. Invest in your prompts for the trifecta to achieve asymmetric engineering in the age of agents."

# FACTS

- Modern language models running in agents are powerful enough to understand consistent variable syntax throughout prompts
- Agents can generate concrete task lists from workflow sections in prompts
- XML blocks provide structural communication that works for both agents and human readers
- Information-dense keywords like "important" have measurably more value to language models than verbose alternatives
- Non-deterministic language models produce different results when multiple instances work on the same task
- Context engineering has only two fundamental approaches, referred to as the "R&D framework"
- Agent delegation requires managing information flow between multiple agent instances simultaneously
- Background agents can operate autonomously while reporting progress to files
- Template meta prompts represent the highest tier of both usefulness and skill requirement
- Most prompt engineering value is captured at the B-tier skill level
- Seven distinct levels of agentic prompt formats cover the majority of engineering use cases
- Workflow sections map directly to modern agent coding tools' internal planning systems
- Static variables can be referenced throughout prompts using consistent syntax patterns
- Positional arguments in prompts can interface directly with command-line tool syntax
- Control flow in natural language prompts can effectively manage conditional logic and loops
