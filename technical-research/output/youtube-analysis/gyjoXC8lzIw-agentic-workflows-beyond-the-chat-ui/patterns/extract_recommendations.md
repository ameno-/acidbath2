# RECOMMENDATIONS

- Build file-based agentic workflows instead of relying solely on chat interfaces
- Use drop zones to automate repetitive file processing tasks with agents
- Create configurable YAML files to define specialized workflow triggers and prompts
- Implement agent-agnostic systems to avoid vendor lock-in with specific AI providers
- Structure prompts with purpose, variables, workflow steps, and output format sections
- Leverage programmatic agent SDKs for automated workflow execution capabilities
- Design workflows around repeat engineering tasks that operate on file inputs
- Use directory watchers to trigger agents when files are dropped
- Build single-file scripts that pack maximum value into minimal code
- Reference variables throughout prompts to make workflows flexible and reusable
- Create specialized drop zones for different file types and processing needs
- Automate image generation, editing, transcription, and data processing workflows
- Use the file system as a familiar interface for AI interactions
- Move beyond human-in-the-loop patterns toward autonomous agent operations
- Focus on developing prompt engineering skills as core engineering competency
- Build workflows that can scale to process hundreds or thousands of files
- Use rich terminal logging for clear workflow progress visibility
- Design modular prompt templates that can be easily modified and extended
- Implement parallel agent execution for handling multiple workflows simultaneously
- Think systematically about which repetitive tasks can benefit from agent automation
