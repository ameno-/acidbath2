IDEAS

- MCP servers consume significant context tokens before agents begin working effectively.
- Context window preservation becomes critical when stacking multiple MCP servers together.
- CLI-based approaches provide more granular control over agent tool access patterns.
- Progressive disclosure helps agents access only necessary tools for specific tasks.
- Script-based approaches offer maximum context efficiency through conditional tool loading mechanisms.
- Skills provide Claude-specific progressive disclosure with automatic tool discovery capabilities.
- Prompt engineering remains fundamental for controlling context consumption in agent systems.
- External MCP servers offer zero engineering investment but sacrifice customization control.
- Self-contained single-file scripts maximize portability across different development environments.
- Context engineering skills become increasingly important as agent complexity grows significantly.
- CLI tools work effectively for developers, teams, and agents simultaneously.
- MCP server alternatives trade complexity for improved context window management.
- Prediction markets provide valuable information about future events through betting data.
- Agents can analyze betting market sentiment faster than manual research approaches.
- Tool discovery methods significantly impact agent performance and resource consumption patterns.
- Custom tool implementations require more upfront investment but offer greater flexibility.
- Incremental context loading prevents unnecessary token consumption during agent initialization phases.
- File system scripts enable isolated tool functionality without shared dependency conflicts.
- Agent focus improves when context windows contain only relevant tool information.
- Anthropic recommends wrapping MCP functionality in targeted script-based tool implementations.
- Progressive tool disclosure scales better than loading complete toolsets upfront.
- Engineering trade-offs exist between simplicity, control, and context window efficiency.
- Claude ecosystem lock-in occurs when using skills instead of portable solutions.
- Dedicated single-purpose agents sidestep most context engineering problems effectively.
- CLI-first development enables easier MCP server wrapping for scaling requirements.
- Betting platforms serve dual purposes as information sources and investment opportunities.
- Context preservation becomes essential when managing multiple complex tool integrations.
- Tool belt strategies should prioritize external MCP servers for established solutions.
