Not the variables. Not the fancy control flow. The workflow—your step-by-step play for what the agent should do—drives 90% of the value you'll capture from AI-assisted engineering.\n\nThis post shows you how to build workflow prompts that actually work, with templates you can use today. It also covers the failure modes you'll encounter and how to calculate whether a workflow prompt is worth writing.\n\n## The Core Pattern: Input → Workflow → Output\n\nEvery effective agentic prompt follows this three-step structure:\n\n```mermaid\nflowchart LR\n    subgraph INPUT[\"INPUT\"]\n        I1[Variables]\n        I2[Parameters]\n        I3[Context]\n    end\n\n    subgraph WORKFLOW[\"WORKFLOW\"]\n        W1[Sequential]\n        W2[Step-by-Step]\n        W3[Instructions]\n    end\n\n    subgraph OUTPUT[\"OUTPUT\"]\n        O1[Report]\n        O2[Format]\n        O3[Structure]\n    end\n\n    INPUT --> WORKFLOW --> OUTPUT\n\n    style INPUT fill:#e3f2fd\n    style WORKFLOW fill:#fff3e0\n    style OUTPUT fill:#c8e6c9\n```\n\nThe workflow section is where your agent's actual work happens. It's rated S-tier usefulness with C-tier difficulty—the most valuable component is also the easiest to execute well.\n\n## POC: A Working Workflow Prompt\n\nHere's a complete, production-ready workflow prompt you can use as a Claude Code command:\n\n```markdown\n---\ndescription: Analyze a file and create implementation plan\nallowed-tools: Read, Glob, Grep, Write\nargument-hint: \u003Cfile_path>\n---\n\n# File Analysis and Planning Agent\n\n## Purpose\nAnalyze the provided file and create a detailed implementation plan for improvements.\n\n## Variables\n- **target_file**: $ARGUMENTS (the file to analyze)\n- **output_dir**: ./specs\n\n## Workflow\n\n1. **Read the target file**\n   - Load the complete contents of {{target_file}}\n   - Note the file type, structure, and purpose\n\n2. **Analyze the codebase context**\n   - Use Glob to find related files (same directory, similar names)\n   - Use Grep to find references to functions/classes in this file\n   - Identify dependencies and dependents\n\n3. **Identify improvement opportunities**\n   - List potential refactoring targets\n   - Note any code smells or anti-patterns\n   - Consider performance optimizations\n   - Check for missing error handling\n\n4. **Create implementation plan**\n   - For each improvement, specify:\n     - What to change\n     - Why it matters\n     - Files affected\n     - Risk level (low/medium/high)\n\n5. **Write the plan to file**\n   - Save to {{output_dir}}/{{filename}}-plan.md\n   - Include timestamp and file hash for tracking\n\n## Output Format\nfile_analyzed: {{target_file}}\ntimestamp: {{current_time}}\nimprovements:\n  - id: 1\n    type: refactor|performance|error-handling|cleanup\n    description: \"What to change\"\n    rationale: \"Why it matters\"\n    files_affected: [list]\n    risk: low|medium|high\n    effort: small|medium|large\n\n## Early Returns\n- If {{target_file}} doesn't exist, stop and report error\n- If file is binary or unreadable, stop and explain\n- If no improvements found, report \"file looks good\" with reasoning\n```\n\nSave this as `.claude/commands/analyze.md` and run with `/analyze src/main.py`.\n\n## The Workflow Section Deep Dive\n\nWhat makes workflow sections powerful:\n\n**Sequential clarity** - Numbered steps eliminate ambiguity. The agent knows exactly what order to execute.\n\n```markdown\n## Workflow\n\n1. Read the config file\n2. Parse the JSON structure\n3. Validate required fields exist\n4. Transform data to new format\n5. Write output file\n```\n\n**Nested detail** - Add specifics under each step without breaking the sequence:\n\n```markdown\n## Workflow\n\n1. **Gather requirements**\n   - Read the user's request carefully\n   - Identify explicit requirements\n   - Note implicit assumptions\n   - List questions if anything is unclear\n\n2. **Research existing code**\n   - Search for similar implementations\n   - Check for utility functions that could help\n   - Review relevant documentation\n```\n\n**Conditional branches** - Handle different scenarios:\n\n```markdown\n## Workflow\n\n1. Check if package.json exists\n2. **If exists:**\n   - Parse dependencies\n   - Check for outdated packages\n   - Generate update recommendations\n3. **If not exists:**\n   - Stop and inform user this isn't a Node project\n```\n\n## When Workflow Prompts Fail\n\nWorkflow prompts are powerful, but they're not universal. Here are the failure modes I've hit in production:\n\n**Overly complex tasks requiring human judgment mid-execution**\n\nI tried building a workflow prompt for database migration planning. The prompt could analyze schema differences and generate SQL, but it couldn't decide which migrations were safe to auto-apply versus which needed DBA review. The decision tree had too many branches: data volume considerations, cross-region timing, rollback complexity, customer impact windows.\n\nThe workflow kept requesting human input at steps 3, 5, 7, and 9 of a 12-step process. At that point, you're better off doing it interactively. Workflow prompts excel when the decision points are clear and the execution path is deterministic.\n\n**Rule of thumb**: If your workflow has more than 2 \"stop and ask the user\" points, it's probably not a good fit.\n\n**Ambiguous requirements that can't be specified upfront**\n\n\"Generate a blog post outline for our next marketing campaign\" sounds like a good workflow candidate. It's not. The requirements shift based on the output. You see the first draft and realize you want a different tone. The second section needs more technical depth. The third needs less.\n\nI wrote a 300-line workflow prompt for content generation that included 15 different quality checks and formatting rules. The agent followed it perfectly and produced consistently mediocre output. The problem wasn't execution—it was that I couldn't articulate \"make it interesting\" in workflow steps.\n\nInteractive prompting lets you course-correct in real-time. Workflow prompts lock in your assumptions upfront.\n\n**Tasks requiring real-time adaptation**\n\nDebugging sessions are the classic example. You can't write a workflow for \"figure out why the auth service is returning 500 errors\" because each finding changes what you need to check next. Step 1 might be \"check logs,\" but what you find in the logs determines whether step 2 is \"inspect database connections\" or \"review API gateway config\" or \"check Redis cache status.\"\n\nWorkflow prompts assume a static execution path. Debugging requires dynamic branching based on runtime discoveries.\n\n**When the overhead of writing the prompt exceeds the task time**\n\nThis is the trap I see most often. Someone spends 2 hours writing a workflow prompt for a task that takes 30 minutes to do manually. They run it once, it works great, and then they never use it again.\n\nIf you're not going to run a workflow at least 5 times, don't build it. Do it manually or use interactive prompting.\n\n**Edge case: Workflows that seem simple but have hidden complexity**\n\n\"Rename this function across the codebase\" sounds trivial. Write a workflow prompt: search for all instances, replace them, update imports, done. Except the function is called `get()` and your codebase has 47 different `get()` functions. Or it's used in generated code. Or it's referenced in documentation strings that need different formatting. Or it's in test mocks that need manual review.\n\nI've seen 10-step workflow prompts fail at step 8 because an edge case no one anticipated appeared. The agent either halted with an error or plowed ahead and broke things. Neither outcome is great when you're at 80% completion.\n\nFor tasks with hidden complexity, start with interactive prompting. Once you've hit the edge cases manually, then codify the workflow.\n\n## Measuring Workflow ROI\n\nThe question you should ask before writing any workflow prompt: \"Will this pay for itself?\"\n\n**Time to write workflow prompt vs time saved**\n\nA workflow prompt takes between 20 minutes (simple, templated) and 3 hours (complex, multi-step). Most fall in the 45-60 minute range if you're building from scratch.\n\nTask execution time varies, but here's the break-even math:\n\n```\nBreak-even uses = (Time to write prompt) / (Time saved per use)\n```\n\nExample 1: Code review workflow\n- Time to write: 60 minutes\n- Manual review time: 20 minutes\n- Time with workflow: 5 minutes (you review the agent's output)\n- Time saved per use: 15 minutes\n- Break-even: 60 / 15 = 4 uses\n\nIf you review code 4+ times, the workflow prompt pays off.\n\nExample 2: API endpoint scaffolding\n- Time to write: 90 minutes (includes error handling, validation, tests)\n- Manual scaffold time: 40 minutes\n- Time with workflow: 8 minutes (review and tweak)\n- Time saved per use: 32 minutes\n- Break-even: 90 / 32 = 2.8 uses (round to 3)\n\nIf you build 3+ similar endpoints, the workflow prompt pays off.\n\n**The multiplier effect**\n\nThis calculation assumes only you use the workflow. If your team uses it, divide break-even by team size.\n\nA 30-minute workflow prompt on a 5-person team needs to save each person just 6 minutes once to break even. That's a no-brainer for common tasks like \"add API endpoint,\" \"generate test file,\" or \"create component boilerplate.\"\n\n**The hidden cost: maintenance**\n\nWorkflow prompts break when your codebase evolves. Your folder structure changes. Your testing framework updates. Your naming conventions shift.\n\nI maintain about 40 workflow prompts for client projects. Roughly 10% break each quarter and need updates. Budget 15-30 minutes per quarter per active workflow for maintenance.\n\nIf a workflow saves you 2 hours per month but costs 30 minutes per quarter to maintain, the net ROI is still massive: 24 hours saved vs 2 hours maintenance over a year.\n\n**When to skip the ROI calculation**\n\nSome workflows are worth it regardless of break-even math:\n- Team onboarding tasks (new hires benefit disproportionately)\n- Critical path operations where consistency matters more than speed\n- Compliance tasks that require documented, repeatable processes\n\nIf the task is high-stakes or high-variance, the value of predictability can exceed the value of time saved.\n\n## Agent Opportunity: Build a Prompt Library\n\nHere's where you can multiply your impact:\n\n```mermaid\nflowchart TD\n    subgraph LIB[\".claude/commands/\"]\n        A[\"analyze.md - File analysis\"]\n        B[\"refactor.md - Guided refactoring\"]\n        C[\"test.md - Generate tests\"]\n        D[\"document.md - Add documentation\"]\n        E[\"review.md - Code review checklist\"]\n        F[\"debug.md - Systematic debugging\"]\n    end\n\n    LIB --> G[\"Each prompt follows: Input → Workflow → Output\"]\n    G --> H[\"Reusable across projects\"]\n    H --> I[\"Serves you, your team, AND your agents\"]\n\n    style LIB fill:#e8f5e9\n```\n\n## Why Workflows Beat Ad-Hoc Prompting\n\n```mermaid\nflowchart LR\n    subgraph ADHOC[\"AD-HOC PROMPTING\"]\n        A1[\"'Help me refactor this'\"]\n        A2[Unpredictable scope]\n        A3[Inconsistent output]\n        A4[No error handling]\n        A5[Can't reuse]\n        A6[Team can't use it]\n    end\n\n    subgraph WORKFLOW[\"WORKFLOW PROMPTING\"]\n        W1[\"Step 1: Backup\"]\n        W2[\"Step 2: Analyze\"]\n        W3[\"Step 3: Plan\"]\n        W4[\"Step 4: Execute\"]\n        W5[\"Step 5: Verify\"]\n        W6[\"Step 6: Document\"]\n    end\n\n    WORKFLOW --> R1[Predictable execution]\n    WORKFLOW --> R2[Consistent format]\n    WORKFLOW --> R3[Early returns on error]\n    WORKFLOW --> R4[Reusable forever]\n    WORKFLOW --> R5[Team multiplier]\n\n    style ADHOC fill:#ffcdd2\n    style WORKFLOW fill:#c8e6c9\n```\n\nThe workflow prompt transforms a vague request into an executable engineering plan. One workflow prompt executing for an hour can generate work that would take you 20 hours.\n\n## Building Your First Workflow Prompt\n\nStart with your most common task. The one you do every day. The one where you think \"I should automate this.\"\n\n1. Write out the steps you take manually\n2. Convert each step to a numbered instruction\n3. Add variables for the parts that change\n4. Add early returns for failure cases\n5. Specify the output format you want\n\nTest it. Iterate. Add to your library.\n\nThe prompt is the new fundamental unit of engineering. The workflow section is where that engineering actually happens.\n\n---\n\n**Key Takeaways:**\n- Workflow sections are S-tier value, C-tier difficulty\n- Input → Workflow → Output is the universal pattern\n- Numbered steps create predictable execution\n- Early returns handle failure cases cleanly\n- Workflows fail on complex judgment calls, ambiguous requirements, and real-time adaptation tasks\n- Break-even calculation: (Time to write) / (Time saved per use) = minimum uses needed\n- A 30-minute workflow prompt pays off after 3 uses of a 15-minute task\n- Build a library of reusable workflow prompts for maximum team ROI\n- One good workflow prompt = 20+ hours of work\n\n**Try It Now:**\nCopy the analyze.md template above, save to `.claude/commands/analyze.md`, and run `/analyze` on any file in your codebase. Time how long it takes to write the prompt and how long the analysis takes to run. Calculate your break-even point for the next time you need to analyze a file.","src/content/blog/workflow-prompts.md","599a4ba0b5b2dd49",{"html":40,"metadata":41},"\u003Cp>The workflow section is the most important thing you’ll write in any agentic prompt.\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>Not the metadata.

The prompt could analyze schema differences and generate SQL, but it couldn’t decide which migrations were safe to auto-apply versus which needed DBA review. The decision tree had too many branches: data volume considerations, cross-region timing, rollback complexity, customer impact windows.\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>The workflow kept requesting human input at steps 3, 5, 7, and 9 of a 12-step process. At that point, you’re better off doing it interactively. Workflow prompts excel when the decision points are clear and the execution path is deterministic.\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>\u003Cstrong>Rule of thumb\u003C/strong>: If your workflow has more than 2 “stop and ask the user” points, it’s probably not a good fit.\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>\u003Cstrong>Ambiguous requirements that can’t be specified upfront\u003C/strong>\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>“Generate a blog post outline for our next marketing campaign” sounds like a good workflow candidate. It’s not. The requirements shift based on the output. You see the first draft and realize you want a different tone. The second section needs more technical depth. The third needs less.\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>I wrote a 300-line workflow prompt for content generation that included 15 different quality checks and formatting rules. The agent followed it perfectly and produced consistently mediocre output. The problem wasn’t execution—it was that I couldn’t articulate “make it interesting” in workflow steps.\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>Interactive prompting lets you course-correct in real-time.

You can’t write a workflow for “figure out why the auth service is returning 500 errors” because each finding changes what you need to check next. Step 1 might be “check logs,” but what you find in the logs determines whether step 2 is “inspect database connections” or “review API gateway config” or “check Redis cache status.”\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>Workflow prompts assume a static execution path.

Write a workflow prompt: search for all instances, replace them, update imports, done. Except the function is called \u003Ccode>get()\u003C/code> and your codebase has 47 different \u003Ccode>get()\u003C/code> functions. Or it’s used in generated code. Or it’s referenced in documentation strings that need different formatting. Or it’s in test mocks that need manual review.\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>I’ve seen 10-step workflow prompts fail at step 8 because an edge case no one anticipated appeared. The agent either halted with an error or plowed ahead and broke things. Neither outcome is great when you’re at 80% completion.\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>For tasks with hidden complexity, start with interactive prompting.

Change it and you change the product entirely.\n\nThe file system is the most reliable context management system. Use it and delegation actually works.\n\nThis post shows you how to build custom agents and delegate research reliably, with complete working examples.\n\n## Why Custom Agents Matter\n\n```mermaid\nflowchart LR\n    subgraph DEFAULT[\"Default Claude Code\"]\n        A[\"You are a helpful AI assistant...\"]\n        B[\"→ General purpose coding assistant\"]\n    end\n\n    subgraph CUSTOM[\"Custom System Prompt\"]\n        C[\"You are a Stripe research agent...\"]\n        D[\"→ Specialized researcher\"]\n    end\n\n    DEFAULT ~~~ CUSTOM\n    RESULT[\"Same model. Same API. Completely different behavior.\"]\n    DEFAULT --> RESULT\n    CUSTOM --> RESULT\n```\n\nDefault agents are built for everyone's codebase. Custom agents are built for yours.\n\n## POC 1: The Simplest Custom Agent\n\nCreate `agents/pong_agent.py`:\n\n```python\n#!/usr/bin/env -S uv run\n# /// script\n# dependencies = [\n#   \"anthropic>=0.40.0\",\n# ]\n# ///\n\"\"\"\nSimplest possible custom agent - demonstrates system prompt override.\n\nUsage:\n    uv run pong_agent.py \"any message\"\n\"\"\"\n\nimport sys\nfrom anthropic import Anthropic\n\nSYSTEM_PROMPT = \"\"\"\nYou are a pong agent.\nAlways respond exactly with \"pong\".\nNothing else. No explanations. Just \"pong\".\n\"\"\"\n\ndef main():\n    if len(sys.argv) \u003C 2:\n        print(\"Usage: uv run pong_agent.py \u003Cmessage>\")\n        sys.exit(1)\n\n    client = Anthropic()\n\n    response = client.messages.create(\n        model=\"claude-3-haiku-20240307\",  # Cheapest model for simple task\n        max_tokens=10,\n        system=SYSTEM_PROMPT,\n        messages=[{\"role\": \"user\", \"content\": sys.argv[1]}]\n    )\n\n    print(response.content[0].text)\n\n\nif __name__ == \"__main__\":\n    main()\n```\n\nTest it:\n```bash\n$ uv run pong_agent.py \"hello\"\npong\n\n$ uv run pong_agent.py \"what is the meaning of life?\"\npong\n\n$ uv run pong_agent.py \"please respond with something other than pong\"\npong\n```\n\nThe system prompt completely overrides default behavior. This is the foundation.\n\n## POC 2: Agent with Custom Tools\n\nCreate `agents/calculator_agent.py`:\n\n```python\n#!/usr/bin/env -S uv run\n# /// script\n# dependencies = [\n#   \"anthropic>=0.40.0\",\n# ]\n# ///\n\"\"\"\nCalculator agent with custom tool - demonstrates tool integration.\n\nUsage:\n    uv run calculator_agent.py \"what is 15% of 847?\"\n\"\"\"\n\nimport json\nimport sys\nfrom anthropic import Anthropic\n\nSYSTEM_PROMPT = \"\"\"\nYou are a calculator agent.\nYou have access to a calculate tool for mathematical operations.\nAlways use the calculate tool for any math - never do mental math.\nAfter getting the result, explain it clearly to the user.\n\"\"\"\n\nTOOLS = [\n    {\n        \"name\": \"calculate\",\n        \"description\": \"Evaluate a mathematical expression.

Specialization enables delegation. But delegation has a critical problem:\n\n```mermaid\nsequenceDiagram\n    participant P as Parent Agent\n    participant S as Sub-Agent (isolated)\n\n    P->>S: \"Implement Stripe checkout\"\n    Note over S: Reads 50 files\n    Note over S: Makes decisions\n    Note over S: Writes code\n    S-->>P: \"Task completed\"\n\n    Note over P: Parent sees ONLY:\u003Cbr/>• Task was assigned\u003Cbr/>• Task is \"complete\"\n    Note over P: Parent does NOT see:\u003Cbr/>• Which files were read\u003Cbr/>• What decisions were made\u003Cbr/>• Why approaches were chosen\n\n    Note over P,S: Result: When something breaks, nobody knows why\n```\n\nThe parent agent has limited information about what the sub-agent actually did. When something isn't 100% correct and you want to fix it—that's where everything breaks down.\n\n## File-Based Context: The Solution\n\n```mermaid\nsequenceDiagram\n    participant P as Parent Agent\n    participant F as File System\n    participant S as Sub-Agent (researcher)\n\n    P->>F: Write context.md\n    P->>S: Research task\n    S->>F: Read context.md\n    Note over S: Researches documentation\n    Note over S: Creates plan\n    S->>F: Write research-report.md\n    S-->>P: \"Research complete: see research-report.md\"\n\n    Note over P: Only ~50 tokens returned\n\n    P->>F: Read research-report.md\n    Note over P: Full context now available\u003Cbr/>• Implements with complete understanding\u003Cbr/>• Can debug because it knows the plan\n\n    Note over P,S: Result: Implementation succeeds, debugging is possible\n```\n\nConversation history gets compacted. Files don't.\n\n**Token reduction: ~80%**\n\nBefore: Sub-agent returns full research in conversation (10,000+ tokens)\nAfter: Sub-agent returns file path (50 tokens)\n\nParent reads file on-demand when ready to implement.\n\n## POC 3: Complete File-Based Context System\n\n### Step 1: Context File Template\n\nCreate `.claude/templates/context.md`:\n\n```markdown\n# Project Context\n\n## Current State\n\u003C!-- What exists now, what's working, what's not -->\n\n## Research Needed\n\u003C!-- Specific questions the sub-agent should answer -->\n1.\n2.\n3.\n\n## Constraints\n\u003C!-- Hard requirements, tech stack, patterns to follow -->\n- Must use:\n- Cannot use:\n- Style:\n\n## Files to Review\n\u003C!-- Specific files relevant to this task -->\n-\n-\n\n## Output Expected\n\u003C!-- What should be in the research report -->\n- Implementation plan\n- Code examples\n- Potential issues\n- Recommended approach\n```\n\n### Step 2: Research Agent Definition\n\nCreate `.claude/agents/researcher.md`:\n\n```markdown\n---\nname: researcher\ndescription: Research sub-agent that gathers information and creates implementation plans\ntools: Read, Glob, Grep, WebFetch, Write\nmodel: haiku\n---\n\n# Research Agent\n\nYou are a research sub-agent. Your job is to gather information and create detailed implementation plans. **You do NOT implement anything.**\n\n## Workflow\n\n1. **Read the context file**\n   - Always start by reading the context.md file passed to you\n   - Understand what's being asked and the constraints\n\n2. **Research the codebase**\n   - Find relevant existing code using Grep and Glob\n   - Understand current patterns and conventions\n   - Identify dependencies and interfaces\n\n3. **Research external documentation**\n   - If the task involves external services, fetch their docs\n   - Find best practices and examples\n   - Note any recent API changes\n\n4. **Create implementation plan**\n   - Step-by-step instructions for implementation\n   - Include actual code snippets where helpful\n   - Note potential issues and how to handle them\n   - List files that will need to be modified\n\n5. **Write research report**\n   - Save to the location specified in context.md\n   - Use clear sections matching the output expected\n   - Include confidence levels for recommendations\n\n6. **Return summary only**\n   - Tell the parent agent: \"Research complete. Report saved to [path]\"\n   - Do NOT include the full report in your response\n   - Keep the summary under 100 words\n\n## Rules\n\n- NEVER implement code, only plan it\n- NEVER call other sub-agents\n- ALWAYS write findings to file, not conversation\n- ALWAYS read context.md first\n```\n\n### Step 3: Implementation Flow\n\n```mermaid\nsequenceDiagram\n    participant U as User\n    participant P as Parent Agent\n    participant F as File System\n    participant S as Sub-Agent (Researcher)\n\n    U->>P: \"Add Stripe checkout\"\n    P->>F: Write context.md\n    Note over F: Project state, constraints, questions\n\n    P->>S: \"Research Stripe checkout.

Create context file:\n   ```\n   Write to ./tmp/context-{task}.md:\n   - Current state of the feature\n   - Specific questions to answer\n   - Constraints and requirements\n   - Expected output format\n   ```\n\n2. Spawn research sub-agent:\n   ```\n   Task: \"Research [topic]. Read context from ./tmp/context-{task}.md.\n         Write report to ./tmp/research-{task}.md\"\n   Agent: researcher\n   Model: haiku (fast, cheap)\n   ```\n\n3. Wait for completion, then:\n   ```\n   Read ./tmp/research-{task}.md\n   ```\n\n4. Implement based on research report\n\n5. Clean up temp files when done\n```\n\n## POC 4: Service-Specific Researchers\n\nBuild specialized research agents for services you use frequently:\n\n### Stripe Research Agent\n\nCreate `.claude/agents/stripe-researcher.md`:\n\n```markdown\n---\nname: stripe-researcher\ndescription: Research Stripe integration patterns and best practices\ntools: Read, Glob, Grep, WebFetch, Write\nmodel: haiku\n---\n\n# Stripe Research Agent\n\nYou research Stripe integrations.

Here are the real limitations:\n\n### 1. Context Isolation Still Exists\n\nThe researcher agent doesn't have access to the parent's conversation history. If critical information only exists in the parent's memory, the researcher will miss it.\n\n**Mitigation:** Be explicit in context.md. Don't assume the researcher \"knows\" anything.\n\n**Example Failure:**\n```\nParent: \"Add error handling like we did for auth\"\nResearcher: ??? (doesn't know how auth error handling works)\n```\n\n**Example Fix:**\n```markdown\n# context.md\n## Error Handling Pattern\nSee src/auth/handler.ts lines 45-67 for our standard error handling pattern.\nUse the same try/catch structure and error response format.\n```\n\n### 2. Research Can Be Wrong\n\nHaiku is fast and cheap but makes mistakes on complex analysis. The researcher might miss edge cases or misunderstand requirements.\n\n**Mitigation:** Review the research report before implementing. Don't blindly trust it.\n\n**Example Failure:**\n```yaml\nrecommendation:\n  approach: \"Use Stripe Charges API\"\n  confidence: high\n```\n\nThis is outdated. Payment Intents is the modern approach. A senior engineer would catch this.\n\n### 3. Overhead on Simple Tasks\n\nCreating context files, spawning agents, reading reports—this adds 30-60 seconds of overhead.\n\n**When to skip delegation:**\n- Task takes \u003C 2 minutes to implement directly\n- You already know exactly what to do\n- No external research needed\n- Single file change with obvious solution\n\n**Numbers:**\n- Simple task direct: 2 minutes\n- Simple task with delegation: 3 minutes (50% overhead)\n- Complex task direct: 30 minutes\n- Complex task with delegation: 15 minutes (50% time saved)\n\nDelegation shines on complex, research-heavy tasks. It's overkill for simple edits.\n\n### 4. File Coordination Complexity\n\nMultiple sub-agents writing to files simultaneously can cause conflicts. If Agent A writes `research-stripe.md` while Agent B tries to read it, race conditions occur.\n\n**Mitigation:** Use distinct file names with timestamps or task IDs.\n\n```bash\n# Good\ntmp/context-stripe-1703012400.md\ntmp/research-stripe-1703012400.md\n\n# Bad\ntmp/context.md  # Which task is this for?\n```\n\n### 5. Debugging Gets Harder\n\nWhen implementation fails, you now have three places to debug:\n1. The context file (was the request clear?)\n2. The research report (was the research correct?)\n3. The implementation (was the code correct?)\n\n**Mitigation:** Keep research reports. Don't delete them. When debugging, check all three layers.\n\n### 6. Cost on Failed Research\n\nIf the researcher misunderstands the task and produces useless output, you've wasted:\n- Haiku API calls (cheap but not free)\n- 30-60 seconds of time\n- Mental context switching\n\n**Mitigation:** Write very specific context files. Vague requests produce vague research.\n\n**Example Vague Request:**\n```markdown\n## Research Needed\n1. How to add payments\n```\n\n**Example Specific Request:**\n```markdown\n## Research Needed\n1. Which Stripe API version should we use? (prefer latest stable)\n2. Payment Intents vs Charges API - which for one-time purchases?\n3. What webhook events do we need to handle for payment confirmation?\n4. How to handle failed payments and retry logic?\n5. What test mode setup is needed?\n```\n\nThe specific version gets useful research. The vague version gets generic documentation summaries.\n\n## Model Selection Strategy\n\n| Task Type | Model | Cost/M | Speed |\n|-----------|-------|--------|-------|\n| Simple routing | Haiku | $0.25 | ⚡⚡⚡ |\n| Text extraction | Haiku | $0.25 | ⚡⚡⚡ |\n| Classification | Haiku | $0.25 | ⚡⚡⚡ |\n| Research (simple) | Haiku | $0.25 | ⚡⚡⚡ |\n| Code review | Sonnet | $3 | ⚡⚡ |\n| Implementation | Sonnet | $3 | ⚡⚡ |\n| Analysis | Sonnet | $3 | ⚡⚡ |\n| Research (complex) | Sonnet | $3 | ⚡⚡ |\n| Complex reasoning | Opus | $15 | ⚡ |\n| Architecture decisions | Opus | $15 | ⚡ |\n| Edge case handling | Opus | $15 | ⚡ |\n| Research (critical) | Opus | $15 | ⚡ |\n\n> **Rule:** Use the cheapest model that solves the problem. Most tasks are Haiku tasks. Don't over-engineer.\n\nFor researchers:\n- **Haiku:** Documentation lookup, simple API pattern research, file structure analysis\n- **Sonnet:** Cross-service integration research, security pattern analysis, performance optimization research\n- **Opus:** Architecture decisions, critical production patterns, edge case exploration\n\nStart with Haiku. Upgrade only if the research is inadequate.\n\n## Architecture: Custom Agent Stack\n\n```mermaid\nflowchart TB\n    subgraph \"Custom Agent\"\n        SP[System Prompt]\n        UP[User Prompt]\n        T[Custom Tools]\n        M[Model Selection]\n    end\n\n    subgraph \"Execution\"\n        API[Claude API]\n        TE[Tool Execution]\n        R[Response]\n    end\n\n    SP --> API\n    UP --> API\n    T --> API\n    M --> API\n\n    API --> |tool_use| TE\n    TE --> |tool_result| API\n    API --> R\n\n    style SP fill:#ffccbc\n    style T fill:#c8e6c9\n    style R fill:#bbdefb\n```\n\nSystem prompts define what the agent does. Tools define how it does it. Model selection defines cost and quality. Context files enable delegation.\n\n## What This Architecture Enables\n\n**Domain-specific logic** — Operations the model can't reason through reliably become deterministic tool calls.\n\n**Optimized context** — Strip out the 12 tools you never use. Add the 3 you always need.\n\n**Specialized behavior** — System prompts tuned for exactly your use cases.\n\n**Cost control** — Haiku for simple tasks, Sonnet for complex ones. No over-engineering.\n\n**Team patterns** — Shared agents that enforce your team's conventions.\n\n**Parallel research** — Multiple sub-agents researching different aspects simultaneously.\n\n**Persistent knowledge** — Research reports accumulate in your project. Future work references past decisions.\n\n**Debuggable workflows** — Always know what was planned and why. Three months later, `git log` shows the research report that led to the implementation.\n\n## The Data Flow\n\n```mermaid\nflowchart TB\n    subgraph Parent[\"PARENT AGENT\"]\n        CH[Conversation History\u003Cbr/>compacts over time]\n        CH --> CTX[context.md\u003Cbr/>persists]\n    end\n\n    subgraph Sub[\"SUB-AGENT\"]\n        READ[Reads context.md]\n        RESEARCH[Does research]\n        REPORT[research-report.md\u003Cbr/>persists]\n        READ --> RESEARCH --> REPORT\n    end\n\n    CTX --> READ\n    REPORT --> RESULT\n\n    subgraph RESULT[Parent reads research-report.md]\n        R1[Full context available]\n        R2[Can implement correctly]\n        R3[Can debug if issues arise]\n    end\n\n    style CTX fill:#c8e6c9\n    style REPORT fill:#c8e6c9\n```\n\nConversation history compacts. Files don't. This is the key insight.\n\n## Rules That Prevent Disasters\n\nAdd these to your research agent definitions:\n\n```markdown\n## Mandatory Rules\n\n1. **Always read context file first**\n   - Never start work without understanding the context\n   - If context file doesn't exist, stop and report error\n\n2. **Never implement, only research**\n   - Your job is to create the plan\n   - The parent agent implements\n\n3. **Never spawn sub-agents**\n   - One level of delegation maximum\n   - Prevents recursive loops and cost explosions\n\n4. **Always write findings to file**\n   - Summary in conversation: \u003C 100 words\n   - Full report in file: as detailed as needed\n\n5. **Update context file when done**\n   - Add \"Last researched: [timestamp]\"\n   - Note any assumptions made\n```\n\nOne level of delegation. Researcher agents never spawn their own sub-agents. This prevents:\n- Recursive delegation loops\n- Cost explosions (agent spawns agent spawns agent...)\n- Context fragmentation\n- Debugging nightmares\n\n## Quick Start: Your First Custom Agent\n\n1. Identify your most repetitive AI task\n2. Write a system prompt that focuses on that task\n3. Choose the cheapest model that works (probably Haiku)\n4. Add tools only if you need deterministic execution\n5. Test with edge cases\n6. Deploy and iterate\n\nFor delegation:\n1. Create the context template (`.claude/templates/context.md`)\n2. Create the researcher agent (`.claude/agents/researcher.md`)\n3. Next time you need research, write a context file and spawn the agent\n4. Read the research report\n5. Implement based on the plan\n\nThe endgame isn't renting computational power from default agents. The endgame is owning specialized agents tuned precisely for your problems, with reliable delegation patterns that actually work.\n\n---\n\n**Key Takeaways:**\n- System prompt = agent identity (same model, different prompt = different product)\n- Tools provide deterministic execution when reasoning isn't reliable\n- Sub-agents research, parent agents implement (context isolation is real)\n- File system is persistent memory between agent sessions (conversation history compacts, files don't)\n- Context files define what to research, research reports contain the full plan\n- 80% token reduction by returning file paths not content\n- One level of delegation prevents recursive loops and cost explosions\n- Match model to task complexity (Haiku → Sonnet → Opus, most tasks are Haiku tasks)\n- Delegation overhead is 30-60 seconds (only worth it for complex tasks)\n- Review research reports before implementing (Haiku makes mistakes on complex analysis)\n\n**Try It Now:**\nCreate `.claude/agents/researcher.md` using the template above. Next time you need to research a new API integration or library, write a context file and delegate to the researcher. Read the report. Implement based on the plan.

Production breaks in predictable ways.\n\n### Files That Need Context\n\nA code file dropped into a review zone lacks its dependencies, imports, and surrounding architecture. The agent sees `import UserService from '../services'` but doesn't know what UserService does.\n\n**What breaks:** Reviews are shallow. \"This looks fine\" instead of \"This violates the retry policy established in commit abc123.\"\n\n**Fix:** Add a context builder. Before processing, scan the repository for related files:\n\n```python\ndef gather_context(filepath: str) -> dict:\n    \"\"\"Gather related files for context.\"\"\"\n    context = {\"main_file\": filepath}\n\n    # Parse imports\n    with open(filepath) as f:\n        content = f.read()\n        imports = extract_imports(content)  # Your parser here\n\n    # Find imported files\n    related = []\n    for imp in imports:\n        path = resolve_import(imp, filepath)\n        if path and os.path.exists(path):\n            with open(path) as f:\n                related.append({\"path\": path, \"content\": f.read()})\n\n    context[\"related_files\"] = related\n    return context\n```\n\nThis increases token usage 3-5x but improves accuracy significantly. For a 200-line Python file with 8 imports, you go from 800 tokens to 3,200 tokens. Cost per review goes from $0.02 to $0.08 with claude-3-5-sonnet-20241022.\n\n### Multi-File Inputs\n\nSometimes the task requires multiple files processed together. A blog post draft plus supporting research notes. Three screenshots that show a UI flow. CSV data plus its schema definition.\n\n**What breaks:** The watcher processes files individually. Drop three related screenshots, get three unconnected analyses instead of one coherent flow analysis.\n\n**Fix:** Add a staging area with batch processing:\n\n```yaml\n# In drops.yaml\nui_review:\n  directory: ~/drops/ui-review\n  patterns: [\"*.png\", \"*.jpg\"]\n  agent: ui_flow_analyzer\n  batch_mode: true\n  batch_window: 30  # seconds\n  batch_trigger: 3  # or N files\n```\n\nBuffer files for 30 seconds. If 3+ files arrive, process as a batch. If timeout hits with fewer files, process what you have.\n\n### Race Conditions: Incomplete Writes\n\nYou drop a 500MB video file. Watchdog fires on create. The agent starts processing while the file is still copying. Whisper transcribes 8 seconds of a 45-minute video.\n\n**What breaks:** Partial processing. Silent failures. Confusing output.\n\n**Fix:** Verify file stability before processing:\n\n```python\ndef wait_for_stable_file(filepath: str, timeout: int = 30) -> bool:\n    \"\"\"Wait until file size stops changing.\"\"\"\n    last_size = -1\n    stable_count = 0\n\n    for _ in range(timeout):\n        try:\n            current_size = os.path.getsize(filepath)\n            if current_size == last_size:\n                stable_count += 1\n                if stable_count >= 3:  # Stable for 3 seconds\n                    return True\n            else:\n                stable_count = 0\n            last_size = current_size\n        except OSError:\n            pass\n        time.sleep(1)\n\n    return False\n```\n\nReplace the POC's `time.sleep(0.5)` with this. A 500MB file takes 6-10 seconds to copy on typical hardware. Three-second stability window catches 99% of cases without excessive waiting.\n\n### Agent Failures Mid-Processing\n\nAPI rate limit hit. Network timeout. Model refuses the prompt due to content policy. The agent fails after archiving the input file but before writing output.\n\n**What breaks:** Input file is gone. No output exists. No way to retry. User thinks it worked because no error appeared.\n\n**Fix:** Transactional processing with rollback:\n\n```python\ndef _process_file(self, filepath: str):\n    if not self._matches_pattern(filepath):\n        return\n\n    # Create processing record\n    processing_id = self._start_processing(filepath)\n\n    try:\n        output_path = self._run_agent(filepath)\n        self._archive_file(filepath)\n        self._mark_complete(processing_id, output_path)\n        console.print(f\"[green]✓[/] Output: {output_path}\")\n    except Exception as e:\n        self._mark_failed(processing_id, str(e))\n        # Don't archive on failure - leave for retry\n        console.print(f\"[red]✗[/] Error: {e}\")\n        # Write error details to dead letter queue\n        self._write_to_dlq(filepath, processing_id, e)\n```\n\nKeep failed files in place. Log failures to a dead letter queue. Provide a manual retry command. For our use case running 200 files/day, we see 3-5 transient failures per day. All are recoverable with retry.\n\n### Token Limit Exceeded\n\nA 15,000-line CSV file hits the analyze zone. The agent tries to stuff it all into a prompt. Claude returns a 400 error: maximum context length exceeded.\n\n**What breaks:** Processing fails. File size limits aren't obvious. No graceful degradation.\n\n**Fix:** Add size checks and chunking strategy:\n\n```python\ndef _check_size_limits(self, filepath: str) -> tuple[bool, str]:\n    \"\"\"Check if file is processable.\"\"\"\n    file_size = os.path.getsize(filepath)\n    max_size = self.agent_config.get(\"max_file_size\", 10 * 1024 * 1024)  # 10MB default\n\n    if file_size > max_size:\n        return False, f\"File too large: {file_size} bytes (max: {max_size})\"\n\n    # For text files, estimate tokens\n    if filepath.endswith(('.txt', '.md', '.csv', '.json')):\n        with open(filepath) as f:\n            content = f.read()\n        estimated_tokens = len(content) // 4  # Rough estimate\n        max_tokens = self.agent_config.get(\"max_tokens\", 100000)\n\n        if estimated_tokens > max_tokens:\n            return False, f\"Content too large: ~{estimated_tokens} tokens (max: {max_tokens})\"\n\n    return True, \"OK\"\n```\n\nFor a 200K-token model, set max_tokens to 150K to leave room for prompts and output. Files that exceed limits go to a manual review folder with a clear error message.\n\n### Files Requiring Human Review\n\nSome automation needs a human checkpoint. Legal contract analysis that might inform business decisions. Code deployments to production. Financial data processing.\n\n**What breaks:** Full automation isn't always desirable. No way to inject human judgment. Liability concerns.\n\n**Fix:** Add an approval workflow:\n\n```yaml\ncontracts:\n  directory: ~/drops/contracts\n  patterns: [\"*.pdf\"]\n  agent: contract_analyzer\n  approval_required: true\n  approval_timeout: 3600  # 1 hour\n```\n\n```python\ndef _process_file(self, filepath: str):\n    output_path = self._run_agent(filepath)\n\n    if self.zone_config.get(\"approval_required\"):\n        approval_path = self._move_to_approval_queue(filepath, output_path)\n        console.print(f\"[yellow]⏸[/] Awaiting approval: {approval_path}\")\n        self._notify_approver(approval_path)\n        # Don't archive yet - wait for approval\n    else:\n        self._archive_file(filepath)\n```\n\nSet up an approval directory. Agent processes the file and moves it there with its output. Human reviews both. Approve by dropping in `~/approvals/accept/`, reject to `~/approvals/reject/`. A second watcher handles the approval directories.\n\n## Production Deployment Considerations\n\nPOC works on your laptop. Production needs operational rigor.\n\n### Monitoring and Alerting\n\n**The problem:** Silent failures. You think it's working. It's been down for three days.\n\n**What to track:**\n\n1. **Processing rate:** Files processed per hour\n2. **Failure rate:** Percentage of files that fail\n3. **Processing latency:** Time from drop to output\n4. **Queue depth:** Files waiting in drop zones\n5. **API health:** Response times and error rates\n\nInstrument the watcher:\n\n```python\nimport statsd  # Or your metrics library\n\nmetrics = statsd.StatsClient('localhost', 8125)\n\ndef _process_file(self, filepath: str):\n    start_time = time.time()\n\n    try:\n        output_path = self._run_agent(filepath)\n        self._archive_file(filepath)\n\n        # Record success\n        metrics.incr(f'dropzone.{self.zone_name}.success')\n        metrics.timing(f'dropzone.{self.zone_name}.duration',\n                      (time.time() - start_time) * 1000)\n    except Exception as e:\n        metrics.incr(f'dropzone.{self.zone_name}.failure')\n        raise\n```\n\nSet alerts:\n- Processing rate drops below 10 files/hour when average is 50/hour\n- Failure rate exceeds 10% over a 15-minute window\n- No files processed in 2 hours during business hours\n- Queue depth exceeds 100 files\n\nFor our production deployment handling 800 files/day, we get 1-2 actionable alerts per week. Most are transient API issues that self-resolve.\n\n### Logging and Audit Trails\n\nEvery file processed needs a record: who dropped it, when, what agent processed it, what the output was, any errors encountered.\n\n```python\nimport json\nimport logging\n\nlogging.basicConfig(\n    filename=os.path.expanduser(\"~/logs/dropzone.log\"),\n    level=logging.INFO,\n    format='%(asctime)s - %(name)s - %(levelname)s - %(message)s'\n)\n\ndef _process_file(self, filepath: str):\n    processing_record = {\n        \"timestamp\": datetime.now().isoformat(),\n        \"zone\": self.zone_name,\n        \"agent\": self.agent_name,\n        \"input_file\": filepath,\n        \"file_size\": os.path.getsize(filepath),\n        \"user\": os.environ.get(\"USER\"),\n    }\n\n    try:\n        output_path = self._run_agent(filepath)\n        processing_record[\"status\"] = \"success\"\n        processing_record[\"output_file\"] = output_path\n        processing_record[\"output_size\"] = os.path.getsize(output_path)\n    except Exception as e:\n        processing_record[\"status\"] = \"failure\"\n        processing_record[\"error\"] = str(e)\n        processing_record[\"error_type\"] = type(e).__name__\n    finally:\n        processing_record[\"duration_seconds\"] = time.time() - start_time\n        logging.info(json.dumps(processing_record))\n```\n\nLogs go to structured JSON for easy parsing. Ship to your log aggregation service. When a user asks \"did my file process?\", you have answers.\n\n### Resource Limits\n\n**CPU and Memory:** Watchdog is lightweight, but agents aren't. Whisper transcription spikes CPU to 100% for 30-60 seconds per file. Claude Code execution can use 2GB RAM.\n\nSet process limits:\n\n```python\nimport resource\n\ndef _run_agent(self, filepath: str) -> str:\n    # Limit memory to 4GB\n    resource.setrlimit(resource.RLIMIT_AS, (4 * 1024**3, 4 * 1024**3))\n\n    # Limit CPU time to 5 minutes\n    resource.setrlimit(resource.RLIMIT_CPU, (300, 300))\n\n    # Run agent...\n```\n\n**API Rate Limits:** Claude API: 50 requests/minute on tier 1, 5,000 requests/minute on tier 4. Replicate varies by model.\n\nAdd rate limiting:\n\n```python\nfrom time import time\nfrom collections import deque\n\nclass RateLimiter:\n    def __init__(self, max_requests: int, window_seconds: int):\n        self.max_requests = max_requests\n        self.window = window_seconds\n        self.requests = deque()\n\n    def acquire(self):\n        now = time()\n        # Remove old requests outside window\n        while self.requests and self.requests[0] \u003C now - self.window:\n            self.requests.popleft()\n\n        if len(self.requests) >= self.max_requests:\n            sleep_time = self.requests[0] + self.window - now\n            time.sleep(sleep_time)\n\n        self.requests.append(now)\n\n# In agent code\nrate_limiter = RateLimiter(max_requests=45, window_seconds=60)\n\ndef _run_claude_agent(self, filepath: str, output_dir: str) -> str:\n    rate_limiter.acquire()\n    # Call API...\n```\n\nLeave headroom. 45 requests/minute for a 50 req/min limit. Shared rate limiters if you have multiple services using the same API key.\n\n### Graceful Degradation\n\nAPIs go down. Networks fail. Disk fills up. Production systems need fallbacks.\n\n**When Claude API is unavailable:**\n\n```python\ndef _run_claude_agent(self, filepath: str, output_dir: str) -> str:\n    try:\n        # Normal Claude processing\n        return self._call_claude_api(filepath, output_dir)\n    except anthropic.APIConnectionError:\n        # Fallback to queue\n        return self._queue_for_retry(filepath)\n    except anthropic.RateLimitError:\n        # Back off and retry once\n        time.sleep(60)\n        return self._call_claude_api(filepath, output_dir)\n```\n\n**When disk space is low:**\n\n```python\ndef _check_disk_space(self) -> bool:\n    stat = os.statvfs(os.path.expanduser(\"~/output\"))\n    free_bytes = stat.f_bavail * stat.f_frsize\n    free_gb = free_bytes / (1024**3)\n\n    if free_gb \u003C 1.0:  # Less than 1GB free\n        console.print(\"[red]Low disk space![/] Pausing processing.\")\n        return False\n    return True\n```\n\nCheck before each file. Pause processing if disk is full. Alert on low space. For systems processing 50GB/day, check every 10 files and alert at 10GB free.\n\n### Security: Validating File Contents\n\nUsers drop files. Users are unpredictable. Protect your system.\n\n**File type validation:**\n\n```python\nimport magic  # python-magic library\n\ndef _validate_file(self, filepath: str) -> tuple[bool, str]:\n    # Check declared extension matches actual content\n    mime = magic.from_file(filepath, mime=True)\n\n    allowed_types = self.zone_config.get(\"allowed_mime_types\", [])\n    if allowed_types and mime not in allowed_types:\n        return False, f\"Invalid file type: {mime}\"\n\n    # Check for malicious content\n    if mime.startswith(\"application/x-executable\"):\n        return False, \"Executable files not allowed\"\n\n    return True, \"OK\"\n```\n\n**Content sanitization:**\n\n```python\ndef _sanitize_content(self, content: str) -> str:\n    # Remove potential injection attacks\n    content = content.replace(\"```python\", \"```text\")\n    content = content.replace(\"```bash\", \"```text\")\n\n    # Limit size\n    max_chars = 500000  # ~125K tokens\n    if len(content) > max_chars:\n        content = content[:max_chars] + \"\\n\\n[Content truncated]\"\n\n    return content\n```\n\nNever execute code from dropped files directly. Treat all input as untrusted. Validate, sanitize, then process.\n\n## The Automation Decision Framework\n\nNot every task deserves automation. Use specific thresholds.\n\n| Frequency | ROI Threshold | Action |\n|-----------|---------------|--------|\n| Once | N/A | Use chat |\n| 2-5x/month | > 5 min saved | Maybe automate |\n| Weekly | > 2 min saved | Consider zone |\n| Daily | > 30 sec saved | Build zone |\n| 10+ times/day | Any time saved | Definitely zone |\n\n| Complexity | Time to Build | Approach |\n|------------|---------------|----------|\n| Single step | 5 minutes | Bash agent |\n| Multi-step | 30 minutes | Python agent |\n| AI reasoning | 15 minutes | Claude agent |\n| Mixed flow | 1-2 hours | Chain agents |\n| Needs approval | 2-3 hours | Approval workflow |\n\n| Risk Level | Requirements | Safety |\n|------------|--------------|--------|\n| Low | None | Full auto |\n| Medium | Logging | Auto + audit |\n| High | Review | Approval required |\n| Critical | Sign-off | Manual only |\n\n**Real numbers from our deployment:**\n- Morning meeting transcription: 10x/week, saves 15 min/day, ROI: 2.5 hours/week\n- Code review: 30x/week, saves 3 min each, ROI: 1.5 hours/week\n- Data analysis: 5x/week, saves 20 min each, ROI: 1.7 hours/week\n- Legal contract review: 2x/month, approval required, ROI: 40 min/month\n\nTotal time saved: 22 hours/month. Setup time: 8 hours. Break-even in 2 weeks.\n\n## Agent Opportunity: Build Your Drop Zone Library\n\nStart with these high-value zones:\n\n### Morning Debrief Zone\n\n```yaml\n# In drops.yaml\nmorning_debrief:\n  directory: ~/drops/debrief\n  patterns: [\"*.m4a\", \"*.mp3\", \"*.wav\"]\n  agent: debrief_processor\n  events: [created]\n\nagents:\n  debrief_processor:\n    type: bash\n    command: |\n      # Transcribe\n      whisper \"{file}\" -o /tmp --output_format txt\n\n      # Extract filename for transcript\n      BASENAME=$(basename \"{file}\" | sed 's/\\.[^.]*$//')\n\n      # Process with Claude\n      cat /tmp/$BASENAME.txt | claude --prompt \"$(cat prompts/debrief.md)\" > \"{output_dir}/$BASENAME-insights.md\"\n```\n\n### Code Review Zone\n\n```yaml\ncode_review:\n  directory: ~/drops/review\n  patterns: [\"*.py\", \"*.ts\", \"*.js\", \"*.go\"]\n  agent: code_review\n  events: [created]\n\nagents:\n  code_review:\n    type: claude\n    prompt_file: prompts/code_review.md\n    model: claude-sonnet-4-20250514\n```\n\n### Research Paper Zone\n\n```yaml\nresearch:\n  directory: ~/drops/papers\n  patterns: [\"*.pdf\"]\n  agent: paper_summarize\n  events: [created]\n\nagents:\n  paper_summarize:\n    type: python\n    script: agents/paper_processor.py\n```\n\n## Running the System\n\n```bash\n# Create the directory structure\nmkdir -p ~/drops/{transcribe,analyze,images,data}\nmkdir -p ~/output ~/archive ~/logs\nmkdir -p prompts agents\n\n# Start the watcher\nuv run drop_watcher.py --config drops.yaml\n\n# In another terminal, test it:\necho \"Write a blog post about AI automation\" > ~/drops/analyze/test.txt\n\n# Check output\nls ~/output/analyze/\ncat ~/output/analyze/*.md\n```\n\n## The Key Insight\n\n**Repeat workflows benefit most from automation.**\n\nThe first time you do something, chat is fine. The tenth time, you should have a drop zone.\n\nDirectory watchers work because they match how you already work. You already organize files into folders. You already drag and drop. The interface is invisible.\n\nThey're called agents for a reason. They're capable of agency. Lean into the autonomy.\n\n---\n\n**Key Takeaways:**\n- Directory watchers turn the file system into an AI interface with zero learning curve\n- YAML config makes adding new zones a 5-minute task\n- Pattern matching routes files to appropriate agents automatically\n- Production requires monitoring, logging, rate limiting, and error handling\n- Failure modes are predictable: context gaps, race conditions, size limits, approval needs\n- ROI threshold: anything you do 10+ times/week that takes more than 30 seconds\n- Start with your highest-frequency task and expand from there\n\n**Try It Now:**\nCopy `drop_watcher.py` and `drops.yaml` above. Create the directory structure. Start the watcher. Drop a text file into `~/drops/analyze/`. Watch it process automatically and check `~/output/analyze/` for results.","src/content/blog/directory-watchers.md","ace24d794862ba90",{"html":213,"metadata":214},"\u003Cp>Directory watchers turn your file system into an AI interface.\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>Drag a file into a folder.

Every token your agent loads before it starts working is a tax on productivity.\n\nThis post shows you how to engineer context consumption—from basic token optimization with progressive disclosure, to large codebase mastery with semantic search. Working code, hard numbers, honest failure modes included.\n\n## The Core Problem: Context is Precious\n\nYour context window is your budget. MCP servers spend it like a trust fund kid.\n\n```mermaid\nflowchart TD\n    A([Agent starts]) --> B[Load ALL tools\u003Cbr/>from ALL MCPs]\n    B --> |10,000 tokens\u003Cbr/>per MCP server| C[40,000 tokens consumed]\n    C --> |20% of context GONE\u003Cbr/>before any work starts| D([Agent begins work\u003Cbr/>with 80% remaining])\n\n    style C fill:#ffcdd2\n```\n\nFour MCP servers at 10,000 tokens each = 40,000 tokens consumed before you type a single character.\n\nIf tools consume more than 15% of your context, you have an architecture problem. For many use cases, [Claude Skills](/blog/claude-skills-deep-dive) offer a lighter-weight alternative—loading ~100 tokens of metadata upfront and only fetching full instructions when triggered.\n\n## Pattern 1: Progressive Disclosure\n\nProgressive disclosure loads tools only when needed. Instead of front-loading everything, give your agent an index of what exists—and let it load only what it uses.\n\n```mermaid\nflowchart TD\n    A([Agent starts]) --> B[Load PRIME only\u003Cbr/>index of tools]\n    B --> |~500 tokens| C{Agent needs\u003Cbr/>market data?}\n    C --> |Yes| D[Load ONLY\u003Cbr/>market_search.py]\n    D --> |2,000 tokens| E([Agent continues\u003Cbr/>with 98% context remaining])\n\n    style B fill:#c8e6c9\n    style E fill:#c8e6c9\n```\n\nResult: 2,500 tokens instead of 40,000. 94% reduction.\n\n### Implementation: Tool Index + UV Scripts\n\nCreate a tool index as a simple markdown file:\n\n**`~/tools/README.md`**\n```markdown\n# Available Tools\n\nYou have access to the following tool scripts. **Do not read script contents unless --help doesn't provide enough information.**\n\n## Market Tools\nLocated in: `~/tools/market/`\n- `search.py` - Search prediction markets by keyword\n- `get_market.py` - Get details for specific market ID\n- `get_orderbook.py` - Get current orderbook for market\n\n## Data Tools\nLocated in: `~/tools/data/`\n- `fetch_csv.py` - Download CSV from URL\n- `analyze_csv.py` - Basic statistical analysis\n- `transform_csv.py` - Transform/filter CSV data\n\n## When you need a tool:\n1. Run `uv run ~/tools/{category}/{script}.py --help`\n2. Read the help output to understand usage\n3. Run the tool with appropriate arguments\n4. Only read script source if help is insufficient\n```\n\nThis index costs ~200 tokens. The agent knows WHERE tools are without loading them.\n\nEach tool is a UV single-file script with embedded dependencies:\n\n**`~/tools/market/search.py`**\n```python\n#!/usr/bin/env -S uv run\n# /// script\n# dependencies = [\n#   \"requests>=2.31.0\",\n#   \"rich>=13.0.0\",\n# ]\n# ///\n\"\"\"\nSearch prediction markets by keyword.\n\nUsage:\n    uv run search.py --query \"election\" [--limit 10]\n\nArguments:\n    --query, -q    Search term (required)\n    --limit, -l    Max results (default: 10)\n    --format, -f   Output format: json|table (default: table)\n\"\"\"\n\nimport argparse\nimport json\nimport requests\nfrom rich.console import Console\nfrom rich.table import Table\n\nKALSHI_API = \"https://trading-api.kalshi.com/trade-api/v2\"\n\ndef search_markets(query: str, limit: int = 10) -> list:\n    \"\"\"Search Kalshi markets by keyword.\"\"\"\n    response = requests.get(\n        f\"{KALSHI_API}/markets\",\n        params={\"status\": \"open\", \"limit\": limit},\n        headers={\"Accept\": \"application/json\"}\n    )\n    response.raise_for_status()\n\n    markets = response.json().get(\"markets\", [])\n    # Filter by query in title\n    return [m for m in markets if query.lower() in m.get(\"title\", \"\").lower()][:limit]\n\ndef main():\n    parser = argparse.ArgumentParser(description=\"Search prediction markets\")\n    parser.add_argument(\"-q\", \"--query\", required=True, help=\"Search term\")\n    parser.add_argument(\"-l\", \"--limit\", type=int, default=10, help=\"Max results\")\n    parser.add_argument(\"-f\", \"--format\", choices=[\"json\", \"table\"], default=\"table\")\n\n    args = parser.parse_args()\n\n    markets = search_markets(args.query, args.limit)\n\n    if args.format == \"json\":\n        print(json.dumps(markets, indent=2))\n    else:\n        console = Console()\n        table = Table(title=f\"Markets matching '{args.query}'\")\n        table.add_column(\"ID\", style=\"cyan\")\n        table.add_column(\"Title\", style=\"green\")\n        table.add_column(\"Volume\", justify=\"right\")\n\n        for m in markets:\n            table.add_row(\n                m.get(\"ticker\", \"\"),\n                m.get(\"title\", \"\")[:50],\n                str(m.get(\"volume\", 0))\n            )\n\n        console.print(table)\n\nif __name__ == \"__main__\":\n    main()\n```\n\n### The Flow in Practice\n\n```\nUser: \"What's the current price on election markets?\"\n\nAgent:\n1. Reads ~/tools/README.md (200 tokens)\n2. Sees market/search.py exists\n3. Runs: uv run ~/tools/market/search.py --help (500 tokens)\n4. Learns usage from help output\n5. Runs: uv run ~/tools/market/search.py -q \"election\"\n6. Returns results\n\nTotal context: ~2,700 tokens\nMCP equivalent: ~10,000 tokens\n```\n\n### Progressive Disclosure Numbers\n\n| Approach | Initial Load | Per-Tool Cost | 4 Tools Used |\n|----------|-------------|---------------|--------------|\n| MCP Server | 10,000 tokens | 0 (pre-loaded) | 10,000 |\n| Progressive | 200 tokens | 500-2,000 | 2,200-8,200 |\n\nProgressive disclosure wins when you use fewer than all available tools—which is almost always. Most tasks use 2-3 tools out of 20 available.\n\nFor taking this pattern further, see [Single-File Scripts](/blog/single-file-scripts)—UV and Bun scripts that replace entire MCP servers with zero-config executables.\n\n## Pattern 2: Semantic Search for Large Codebases\n\nProgressive disclosure optimizes tool loading. But when you're working with large codebases, the problem isn't tool overhead—it's search strategy.\n\nBrute-force text search doesn't scale. Semantic search does.\n\n### Why Text Search Fails\n\n```mermaid\nflowchart TD\n    TASK[\"Task: Rename UserService → UserManager\"]\n    TASK --> S1\n\n    subgraph S1[\"Step 1: grep -r\"]\n        G1[847 matches across 312 files]\n        G2[Includes comments, strings, similar names]\n        G3[15,000 tokens consumed]\n    end\n\n    S1 --> S2\n    subgraph S2[\"Step 2: Read files\"]\n        R1[Agent reads each file]\n        R2[Looking for actual type usage]\n        R3[More tokens consumed]\n    end\n\n    S2 --> S3\n    subgraph S3[\"Step 3: Make changes\"]\n        C1[Text replacement]\n        C2[Misses generic constraints]\n        C3[Misses reflection usage]\n    end\n\n    S3 --> S4\n    subgraph S4[\"Step 4: Build fails\"]\n        F1[Agent scans again]\n        F2[More tokens]\n        F3[Loop continues...]\n    end\n\n    S4 --> |Retry loop| S1\n    S4 --> RESULT[3 hours, 28M tokens, $14, still broken]\n\n    style RESULT fill:#ffcdd2\n```\n\nThe build-fail-retry cycle is the productivity bottleneck. Text search guarantees you'll hit it.\n\n### How Semantic Search Works\n\n```mermaid\nflowchart TD\n    TASK[\"Task: Rename UserService → UserManager\"]\n    TASK --> S1\n\n    subgraph S1[\"Step 1: find_symbol\"]\n        F1[\"find_symbol('UserService', type='class')\"]\n        F2[Semantic understanding of code structure]\n        F3[Returns: definition location, all usages]\n        F4[500 tokens consumed]\n    end\n\n    S1 --> S2\n    subgraph S2[\"Step 2: rename_symbol\"]\n        R1[\"rename_symbol('UserService', 'UserManager')\"]\n        R2[Uses compiler's refactoring engine]\n        R3[Handles generics, reflection, inheritance]\n    end\n\n    S2 --> S3\n    subgraph S3[\"Step 3: Done\"]\n        D1[Build passes first try]\n        D2[5 minutes total]\n    end\n\n    S3 --> RESULT[5 minutes, 1M tokens, $0.60, works]\n\n    style RESULT fill:#c8e6c9\n```\n\nThe key difference:\n- Text search: \"Find this string anywhere\"\n- Semantic search: \"Find this symbol in the AST\"\n\nSemantic search understands code structure. It knows the difference between a type name, a string literal that happens to contain that text, and a comment mentioning it.\n\n### Setting Up Serena MCP\n\nSerena provides semantic search for multiple languages (TypeScript, JavaScript, Python, Go, Rust).\n\n**Installation:**\n\n```bash\n# Clone the repository\ngit clone https://github.com/oramasearch/serena.git\ncd serena\n\n# Install dependencies\nnpm install\n\n# Build the project\nnpm run build\n```\n\n**Configuration for Claude Code:**\n\nAdd to `~/.claude/mcp.json`:\n\n```json\n{\n  \"mcpServers\": {\n    \"serena\": {\n      \"command\": \"node\",\n      \"args\": [\"/absolute/path/to/serena/dist/index.js\"],\n      \"env\": {\n        \"PROJECT_ROOT\": \".\"\n      }\n    }\n  }\n}\n```\n\n**Available tools:**\n\n| Tool | Description |\n|------|-------------|\n| `find_symbol` | Find symbol definition and all usages |\n| `find_references` | Find all references to a symbol |\n| `get_definition` | Get the definition of a symbol at a location |\n| `semantic_search` | Search code semantically, not just text |\n| `get_file_symbols` | List all symbols in a file |\n\n### Adding Language-Specific Refactoring\n\nFor C#/.NET, add Refactor MCP for Roslyn-powered operations:\n\n```bash\n# Clone the repository\ngit clone https://github.com/JetBrains/refactor-mcp.git\ncd refactor-mcp\n\n# Build\ndotnet build\n```\n\nAdd to MCP config:\n\n```json\n{\n  \"mcpServers\": {\n    \"refactor\": {\n      \"command\": \"dotnet\",\n      \"args\": [\"run\", \"--project\", \"/path/to/refactor-mcp\"],\n      \"env\": {\n        \"SOLUTION_PATH\": \"/path/to/your/solution.sln\"\n      }\n    }\n  }\n}\n```\n\n**Available refactoring operations:**\n\n| Tool | Description |\n|------|-------------|\n| `rename_symbol` | Rename with full semantic awareness |\n| `extract_method` | Extract code into a new method |\n| `inline_method` | Inline a method at call sites |\n| `extract_interface` | Create interface from class |\n| `move_type` | Move type to another file/namespace |\n\n### The Numbers: 55,000 File Codebase\n\nReal measurements from a production codebase:\n\n| Metric | Text Search | Semantic Search | Improvement |\n|--------|-------------|-----------------|-------------|\n| Time | 3 hours | 5 minutes | 36x |\n| Tokens | 28M | 1M | 28x |\n| Cost | $14 | $0.60 | 23x |\n| Human intervention | Constant | None | ∞ |\n| Build failures | 4 | 0 | - |\n\nThe cost of NOT having semantic tools scales with codebase size. A 10x larger codebase isn't 10x worse—it's 100x worse with text search.\n\n### Workflow Comparison\n\n**Without semantic tools (3 hours):**\n\n```\nUser: \"Rename UserService to UserManager across the codebase\"\n\nAgent:\n1. grep -r \"UserService\" . → 847 results\n2. Read 312 files → 28M tokens consumed\n3. Text-replace in each file\n4. Build fails (missed generic constraints)\n5. grep again for the error\n6. Fix, rebuild\n7. Build fails (missed reflection usage)\n8. Loop continues...\n\nResult: 3 hours, multiple human interventions, $14\n```\n\n**With semantic tools (5 minutes):**\n\n```\nUser: \"Rename UserService to UserManager across the codebase\"\n\nAgent:\n1. find_symbol(\"UserService\") → 42 actual usages\n2. rename_symbol(\"UserService\", \"UserManager\")\n3. Build passes\n\nResult: 5 minutes, autonomous, $0.60\n```\n\n## When This Fails: Honest Limitations\n\nBoth patterns have failure modes. Here's what doesn't work.\n\n### Progressive Disclosure Failures\n\n**Setup overhead becomes the bottleneck:**\n- If you're prototyping and need 15 different tools quickly, progressive disclosure adds friction\n- Writing UV scripts and maintaining a tool index takes time\n- For one-off tasks, the setup cost exceeds the savings\n\n**Language and dependency constraints:**\n- UV is Python-focused; other languages need different patterns\n- Binary tools require wrapper scripts\n- Complex authentication flows are harder to embed in single files\n\n**When tool reuse is low:**\n- If every task needs a new custom script, you're not saving context\n- The index becomes noise if most tools are one-time use\n\n### Semantic Search Failures\n\n**Initial indexing cost:**\n- First run on a large codebase can take minutes to hours\n- Index storage can be GBs for very large projects\n- Re-indexing after major refactors adds overhead\n\n**Language support gaps:**\n- Not all languages have mature semantic tooling\n- Dynamic languages (Ruby, PHP) have weaker semantic analysis\n- Mixed codebases (Python + JavaScript + Go) need multiple MCP servers\n\n**False confidence in refactoring:**\n- Semantic tools can't catch runtime-only issues\n- Reflection-heavy code may still break\n- Cross-service boundaries aren't tracked\n\n**Setup complexity:**\n- Requires building/installing language-specific servers\n- Configuration mistakes lead to silent failures\n- Version mismatches between tools and target code\n\n**Cost isn't always lower:**\n- For small codebases (\u003C 100 files), text search is faster\n- For simple string replacements, grep is sufficient\n- If you only search once, indexing overhead dominates\n\n## Decision Framework: When to Use Which Pattern\n\n```mermaid\nflowchart LR\n    subgraph MCP[\"Standard MCP (80%)\"]\n        M1[External APIs]\n        M2[Vendor tools]\n        M3[Quick prototyping]\n        M4[\"Small codebases (\u003C 100 files)\"]\n    end\n\n    subgraph PD[\"Progressive Disclosure (15%)\"]\n        P1[Custom internal tools]\n        P2[Team-wide utilities]\n        P3[Long-running sessions]\n        P4[Precise token control]\n    end\n\n    subgraph SS[\"Semantic Search (5%)\"]\n        S1[\"Large codebases (> 1,000 files)\"]\n        S2[Type/symbol renaming]\n        S3[Complex type usages]\n        S4[Build-fail-retry cycles]\n    end\n\n    subgraph COMBO[\"Combine Progressive + Semantic\"]\n        C1[Load semantic MCP only when refactoring]\n        C2[Keep tool index lightweight]\n        C3[Semantic for code, progressive for APIs]\n    end\n\n    style MCP fill:#e3f2fd\n    style PD fill:#fff3e0\n    style SS fill:#fce4ec\n    style COMBO fill:#e8f5e9\n```\n\n### The Selection Test\n\nAsk these questions:\n\n1. **How many files will be touched?**\n   - \u003C 10 files: Text search is fine\n   - 10-100 files: Text search with careful prompting\n   - 100-1,000 files: Consider semantic\n   - 1,000+ files: Semantic is required\n\n2. **How many tools will be used?**\n   - All of them: MCP upfront loading is fine\n   - Most of them: MCP is fine\n   - Some of them: Progressive disclosure wins\n   - Few of them: Progressive disclosure wins heavily\n\n3. **What's the task complexity?**\n   - String replacement: Text search works\n   - Symbol renaming: Semantic required\n   - Cross-file refactoring: Semantic required\n   - Type hierarchy changes: Semantic required\n\n4. **Is this a one-off or repeated work?**\n   - One-off: Setup cost dominates, use simple tools\n   - Repeated: Setup cost amortizes, invest in optimization\n\n## Key Takeaways\n\n- Context is finite; every pre-loaded token is a tax on productivity\n- Progressive disclosure reduces tool overhead by 90%+ when you don't use all tools\n- Semantic search provides 28x token reduction and 36x speed improvement on large codebases\n- Combine both: use progressive disclosure for tool loading, semantic search for code operations\n- Text search fails at scale due to build-fail-retry cycles\n- Setup overhead is real; optimize only when the math supports it\n- Most codebases (\u003C 100 files) don't need semantic tools\n- Tool sophistication matters more than raw model capability for large codebases\n\n## Try It Now\n\n**For progressive disclosure:**\nCreate `~/tools/README.md` with an index of 3 UV scripts. Point your agent at it instead of loading an MCP server. Track token consumption with `/context` in Claude Code.\n\n**For semantic search:**\nInstall Serena MCP. Run `find_symbol` on a type in your codebase. Compare the results and token usage to `grep -r`. If you're touching more than 100 files, measure the difference.\n\nThe best context engineering is invisible.

Zero config. Full functionality.\n\nDolph is 1,015 lines of TypeScript that replace an MCP server. No daemon processes. No configuration YAML. No separate type definitions. Just `bun dolph.ts --task list-tables` or import it as a library.\n\nThis is the single-file script pattern for AI tooling.\n\n## The Problem with MCP Servers\n\nModel Context Protocol servers are powerful, but they come with overhead:\n\n- **Process management** - Start server, maintain connection, handle crashes\n- **Configuration files** - `mcp.json`, server settings, transport config\n- **Type separation** - Tool definitions in one place, types in another\n- **Distribution** - Users install server, configure Claude Desktop, troubleshoot permissions\n\nFor simple database queries or file operations, this is too much machinery.\n\n## When Single-File Scripts Win\n\nUse single-file scripts when you need:\n\n1. **Zero server management** - Run directly, no background processes\n2. **Dual-mode execution** - Same file works as CLI tool AND library import\n3. **Portable distribution** - One file (or one file + package.json for dependencies)\n4. **Fast iteration** - Change code, run immediately, no restart\n5. **Standalone binaries** (Bun only) - Compile to self-contained executable\n\nDolph demonstrates all five. Let's break down the pattern.\n\n## Case Study: Dolph Architecture\n\n### 1. Dual-Mode Execution in One File\n\n```typescript\n#!/usr/bin/env bun\n/**\n * CLI Usage:\n *   bun dolph.ts --task test-connection\n *   bun dolph.ts --chat \"What tables are in this database?\"\n *\n * Server Usage:\n *   import { executeMySQLTask, runMySQLAgent } from \"./dolph.ts\";\n *   const result = await runMySQLAgent(\"Show me all users created today\");\n */\n\n// ... 1000+ lines of implementation ...\n\n// Entry point detection\nconst isMainModule = import.meta.main;\n\nif (isMainModule) {\n  runCLI().catch(async (error) => {\n    console.error(\"❌ Fatal error:\", error);\n    await closeConnection();\n    process.exit(1);\n  });\n}\n```\n\n**Pattern**: Use `import.meta.main` (Bun/Node) or `if __name__ == \"__main__\"` (Python) to detect execution mode. Export functions for library use, run CLI logic when executed directly.\n\n### 2. Type-Safe Without Separate Type Files\n\n```typescript\n// Types defined inline with Zod schemas\nconst listTablesTool = tool({\n  name: \"list_tables\",\n  description: \"List all tables in the current database with metadata.\",\n  parameters: z.object({\n    include_row_counts: z.boolean()\n      .optional()\n      .default(false)\n      .describe(\"Fetch exact row counts (slower but accurate)\"),\n  }),\n  async execute({ include_row_counts }): Promise\u003Cstring> {\n    const tables = await listTablesImpl(include_row_counts);\n    return JSON.stringify(tables, null, 2);\n  },\n});\n\n// TypeScript interfaces for exports\nexport interface TableInfo {\n  table_name: string;\n  table_type: string;\n  engine: string | null;\n  estimated_rows: number | null;\n  exact_row_count?: number;\n}\n```\n\n**Pattern**: Zod schemas provide runtime validation AND type inference. Export TypeScript interfaces for library consumers. Keep everything in one file.\n\n### 3. Dual-Gate Security Pattern\n\n```typescript\nconst WRITE_PATTERNS = /^(INSERT|UPDATE|DELETE|DROP|CREATE|ALTER|TRUNCATE|REPLACE)/i;\n\nasync function runQueryImpl(sql: string, allowWrite = false): Promise\u003CQueryResult> {\n  const config = getConfig();\n\n  if (isWriteQuery(sql)) {\n    // Gate 1: Caller must explicitly allow writes\n    if (!allowWrite) {\n      throw new Error(\"Write operations require allowWrite=true parameter\");\n    }\n    // Gate 2: Environment must enable writes globally\n    if (!config.allowWrite) {\n      throw new Error(\"Write operations disabled by configuration. Set MYSQL_ALLOW_WRITE=true\");\n    }\n  }\n\n  // Auto-limit SELECT queries\n  const finalSql = enforceLimit(sql, config.rowLimit);\n  const [result] = await db.execute(finalSql);\n\n  return { rows: result, row_count: result.length, duration_ms };\n}\n```\n\n**Pattern**: Layer multiple security checks. Require BOTH function parameter AND environment variable for destructive operations. Auto-enforce limits on read operations.\n\n### 4. Built-In Performance Reporting\n\n```typescript\nclass TerminalReporter {\n  private toolStartTimes = new Map\u003Cstring, number>();\n\n  onToolStart(toolCall: any, opts: { verbose: boolean }): void {\n    this.toolStartTimes.set(toolCall.id, performance.now());\n    process.stdout.write(`\\n→ tool: ${toolCall.name}\\n`);\n    if (opts.verbose) {\n      console.log(JSON.stringify(toolCall.arguments, null, 2));\n    }\n    startSpinner(\"Dolph is working...\");\n  }\n\n  onToolEnd(toolCall: any, result: any, opts: { verbose: boolean }): void {\n    const duration = performance.now() - this.toolStartTimes.get(toolCall.id);\n    process.stdout.write(`✓ tool: ${toolCall.name} (${formatMs(duration)})\\n`);\n    if (opts.verbose) {\n      console.log(JSON.stringify(result, null, 2));\n    }\n  }\n}\n```\n\n**Pattern**: Track timing for every operation.

rows : [];\n}\n\nexport async function close(): Promise\u003Cvoid> {\n  if (_db) {\n    await _db.end();\n    _db = null;\n  }\n}\n\n// CLI mode\nif (import.meta.main) {\n  const { values } = parseArgs({\n    args: Bun.argv.slice(2),\n    options: {\n      query: { type: \"string\", short: \"q\" },\n    },\n  });\n\n  if (!values.query) {\n    console.error(\"Usage: bun db-agent.ts --query 'SELECT ...'\");\n    process.exit(1);\n  }\n\n  try {\n    const results = await query(values.query);\n    console.log(JSON.stringify(results, null, 2));\n  } finally {\n    await close();\n  }\n}\n```\n\nSave as `db-agent.ts` with this `package.json`:\n\n```json\n{\n  \"dependencies\": {\n    \"mysql2\": \"^3.6.5\"\n  }\n}\n```\n\nRun it:\n```bash\nbun install\nbun db-agent.ts --query \"SELECT VERSION()\"\n```\n\nOr import it:\n```typescript\nimport { query, close } from \"./db-agent.ts\";\n\nconst users = await query(\"SELECT * FROM users LIMIT 5\");\nconsole.log(users);\nawait close();\n```\n\n## Compiling Bun Scripts to Binaries\n\nBun's killer feature: compile your script to a standalone executable with zero dependencies.\n\n```bash\n# Basic compilation\nbun build --compile ./dolph.ts --outfile dolph\n\n# Optimized for production (2-4x faster startup)\nbun build --compile --bytecode --minify ./dolph.ts --outfile dolph\n\n# Run the binary (no Bun installation needed)\n./dolph --task list-tables\n```\n\nThe binary includes:\n- Your TypeScript code (transpiled)\n- All npm dependencies\n- The Bun runtime\n- Native modules\n\nShip it to users who don't have Bun installed. It just works.\n\n## What Doesn't Work\n\nSingle-file scripts have limits:\n\n1. **Multi-language ecosystems** - If you need Python + Node.js + Rust, use an MCP server\n2. **Complex service orchestration** - Multiple databases, message queues, webhooks? Use a server\n3. **Streaming responses** - MCP's streaming protocol is better for real-time updates\n4. **Shared state across tools** - MCP servers can maintain state between tool calls\n5. **Hot reloading in production** - Servers can reload code without restarting the entire process\n\nIf you hit these limits, graduate to an MCP server. But start simple.\n\n## Progressive Disclosure: Inline Dependencies as Context\n\nThe `# /// script` pattern in UV creates self-documenting code. When you read a Python script, you see its dependencies immediately:\n\n```python\n#!/usr/bin/env -S uv run --script\n# /// script\n# dependencies = [\n#   \"openai>=1.0.0\",\n#   \"mysql-connector-python\",\n#   \"click>=8.0\",\n# ]\n# ///\n\nimport openai\nimport mysql.connector\nimport click\n```\n\nNo hunting for `requirements.txt`. No wondering which version. The context is inline.\n\nFor deeper context engineering patterns, see our [Context Engineering post](/blog/context-engineering) on progressive disclosure and UV scripts.\n\n## Try It Now\n\n**Bun challenge**: Convert one MCP tool to a single-file Bun script\n1. Pick a simple MCP tool (file search, database query, API call)\n2. Create `tool.ts` with dual-mode pattern\n3. Add dependencies to adjacent `package.json`\n4. Test CLI: `bun tool.ts --help`\n5. Test import: `import { execute } from \"./tool.ts\"`\n6. Compile: `bun build --compile tool.ts --outfile tool`\n\n**UV challenge**: Create a single-file database agent\n1. Initialize: `uv init --script db.py --python 3.12`\n2. Add deps: `uv add --script db.py mysql-connector-python click`\n3. Implement query function with CLI argument parsing\n4. Lock it: `uv lock --script db.py`\n5. Make executable: `chmod +x db.py`\n\nBoth should be under 200 lines. If you need more, you need a server.\n\n## Dolph Stats\n\n| Metric | Value |\n|--------|-------|\n| Lines of code | 1,015 |\n| Dependencies | 3 (openai agents SDK, mysql2, zod) |\n| Compile time | 2.3s to standalone binary |\n| Binary size | 89MB (includes Bun runtime + all deps) |\n| Startup time | 52ms (compiled with --bytecode) |\n| Tools exposed | 5 (test connection, list tables, get schema, get all schemas, run query) |\n| Modes | 3 (CLI task mode, CLI chat mode, library import) |\n| Security gates | 2 (parameter + environment variable for writes) |\n\nOne file. Full MySQL agent. No server process.\n\n## When to Use What\n\n| Scenario | Use Single-File Script | Use MCP Server |\n|----------|------------------------|----------------|\n| Database queries | ✓ Dolph pattern | Complex multi-DB orchestration |\n| File operations | ✓ Bun native APIs | File watching, hot reload |\n| API calls | ✓ fetch built-in | Streaming responses |\n| CLI tools | ✓ Compile to binary | Long-running daemons |\n| Library imports | ✓ Direct ESM import | Plugin architectures |\n| Quick prototypes | ✓ Zero config | Production services |\n| Single developer | ✓ One file to manage | Team collaboration on large systems |\n\nStart with a single-file script. Graduate to MCP when you need it.\n\nThe best code is the code you don't write. The best server is the server you don't run.\n\nOne file. Zero config. Full functionality.

Here's what breaks.\n\n### Document Complexity Limits\n\n**Recommended limits:**\n- Excel: 2-3 sheets per workbook\n- PowerPoint: 5-7 slides per deck\n- PDF: 10-15 pages\n\nBeyond these, reliability degrades. Generation time increases exponentially, and partial failures become common.\n\n**Workaround:** Break complex documents into multiple focused files.\n\n```python\n# Bad: One complex 10-sheet Excel\ngenerate_excel(full_data, \"complete_report.xlsx\")  # Fails at scale\n\n# Good: Multiple focused files\ngenerate_excel(pnl_data, \"pnl_report.xlsx\")\ngenerate_excel(balance_data, \"balance_sheet.xlsx\")\ngenerate_excel(kpi_data, \"kpi_dashboard.xlsx\")\n```\n\n### Data Format Sensitivity\n\nSkills are sensitive to input data structure. Slight variations cause unpredictable output.\n\n**Example failure:**\n```python\n# Works\ndata = {\"revenue\": 14500000, \"growth\": 17.9}\n\n# Fails (missing field)\ndata = {\"revenue\": 14500000}  # No growth → chart generation fails\n\n# Fails (wrong type)\ndata = {\"revenue\": \"14.5M\"}   # String not number → formula errors\n```\n\n**Mitigation:** Validate data structure before sending to Skills.\n\n```python\ndef validate_data(data: dict) -> bool:\n    required_fields = [\"revenue\", \"growth\", \"net_income\"]\n    return all(field in data.get(\"summary\", {}).get(\"metrics\", {})\n               for field in required_fields)\n```\n\n### Rate Limits and Timeouts\n\n**Failure modes:**\n- Generating multiple complex documents simultaneously hits rate limits\n- Generation time can vary from 30 seconds to 5 minutes\n- No guaranteed maximum completion time\n\n**Mitigation:** Implement retry logic and sequential execution.\n\n```python\nimport time\nfrom tenacity import retry, stop_after_attempt, wait_exponential\n\n@retry(stop=stop_after_attempt(3), wait=wait_exponential(min=1, max=10))\ndef generate_with_retry(prompt: str, skill_id: str) -> dict:\n    return create_skills_message(prompt, skill_id)\n\ndef sequential_pipeline(data_files: list) -> list:\n    results = []\n    for data_file in data_files:\n        result = generate_with_retry(data_file)\n        results.append(result)\n        time.sleep(2)  # Rate limit buffer\n    return results\n```\n\n### Numeric Precision\n\nFinancial calculations can lose precision. Rounding errors accumulate.\n\n**Example:**\n```\nExpected: $14,500,000.00\nGenerated: $14,499,999.99\n```\n\n**Mitigation:** Specify precision explicitly in prompts.\n\n```python\nprompt = \"\"\"\nFormat all currency values:\n- Use exactly 2 decimal places\n- Round to nearest cent using banker's rounding\n- Display as $X,XXX,XXX.XX format\n\"\"\"\n```\n\n### No Persistent State\n\nEach Skills call is stateless. Documents generated in separate calls may have subtle inconsistencies.\n\n**Example failure:**\n- Excel shows revenue of $14.5M\n- PowerPoint shows revenue of $14.51M (different rounding)\n\n**Mitigation:** Generate all documents from the same data dict in the same session. Pass exact values, not calculated values.\n\n```python\n# Good: Same canonical data\ndata = {\"revenue\": 14500000}\ngenerate_excel(data, ...)\ngenerate_powerpoint(data, ...)  # Same source\n\n# Bad: Calculated values drift\nexcel_data = {\"revenue\": calculate_revenue()}  # 14500000\nppt_data = {\"revenue\": calculate_revenue()}    # 14500001 (race condition)\n```\n\n### Pipeline Fragility\n\nIf step 2 fails, step 3 never runs. One failure breaks the entire pipeline.\n\n**Mitigation:** Implement robust error handling with partial success tracking.\n\n```python\ndef resilient_pipeline(data: dict) -> dict:\n    results = {\"excel\": None, \"powerpoint\": None, \"pdf\": None, \"errors\": []}\n\n    try:\n        results[\"excel\"] = generate_excel(data)\n    except Exception as e:\n        results[\"errors\"].append(f\"Excel failed: {e}\")\n\n    try:\n        results[\"powerpoint\"] = generate_powerpoint(data)\n    except Exception as e:\n        results[\"errors\"].append(f\"PowerPoint failed: {e}\")\n\n    try:\n        results[\"pdf\"] = generate_pdf(data)\n    except Exception as e:\n        results[\"errors\"].append(f\"PDF failed: {e}\")\n\n    return results\n```\n\n## Best Practices: What We Learned\n\n**Document structure:**\n- 2-3 sheets/slides per document for reliable generation\n- Focus each sheet on a single purpose\n- Break complex reports into multiple files\n- Chain documents sequentially, not in parallel\n\n**Prompt design:**\n- Use structured data (JSON) not prose descriptions\n- Specify exact formatting requirements\n- Include examples of expected output\n- Be explicit about formulas and calculations\n\n**Error handling:**\n- Validate data before sending to Skills\n- Implement retry logic with exponential backoff\n- Track partial successes separately from complete failures\n- Log token usage for cost monitoring\n\n**Maintenance:**\n- Monitor token usage trends over time\n- Test prompts when updating to new SDK versions\n- Keep prompt templates versioned with your code\n- Build automated tests for document generation\n\n## Agent Opportunity: Document Generation Agent\n\nBuild a specialized agent for document generation:\n\n```markdown\n---\nname: document-generator\ndescription: Generate multi-format business documents from structured data\ntools: Bash, Read, Write, Skill\nmodel: sonnet\n---\n\n# Document Generation Agent\n\n## Workflow\n\n1. **Validate input data**\n   - Check required fields exist\n   - Verify data types are correct\n   - Normalize date formats\n\n2. **Generate documents sequentially**\n   - Excel first (primary data source)\n   - PowerPoint second (summary view)\n   - PDF third (formal documentation)\n\n3. **Verify outputs**\n   - Check file sizes are reasonable\n   - Verify no generation errors\n   - Log token usage\n\n4. **Report completion**\n   - List generated files with sizes\n   - Summarize token usage and cost\n   - Note any warnings or partial failures\n\n## Rules\n\n- NEVER generate more than 3 sheets per Excel\n- ALWAYS validate data before calling Skills API\n- ALWAYS implement retry logic\n- ALWAYS track token usage for cost management\n```\n\nThis agent can be triggered by file drops in a watched directory—see the Directory Watchers post for that pattern.\n\n---\n\n**Key Takeaways:**\n- Skills generate professional documents (Excel, PowerPoint, PDF) in 1-2 minutes each\n- Pipeline approach: data → Excel → PowerPoint → PDF, 5-6 minutes total\n- 90% fewer tokens than manual document instructions\n- Cost: ~$0.13 per complete pipeline vs $50+ manual labor\n- Reliability limits: 2-3 sheets per Excel, 5-7 slides per PowerPoint\n- Common failures: complexity limits, data format sensitivity, rate limits\n- Mitigations: break complex docs into focused files, validate data, implement retries\n- Best fit: recurring reports, data-to-document conversion, template-based generation\n\n**Try It Now:**\nCopy the `document_pipeline.py` and `sample_data.json` files above. Run `uv run document_pipeline.py --data sample_data.json --output ./reports`. Check the generated files. Modify the prompts for your use case. Track token usage to estimate your costs.\n\n---\n\n*Next in series: Part 2 covers advanced patterns—custom templates, conditional formatting, and multi-source data aggregation.*","src/content/blog/document-generation-skills.md","bb56b6d6f896435f",{"html":518,"metadata":519},"\u003Cp>Document generation is the unsexy automation that saves hours.\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>Not code generation.

Then load instructions only when triggered.\n\nThat's the hook. Now here's why it matters and when you should use Skills instead of the Model Context Protocol.\n\n## The Token Economics Problem\n\nI spent six months building MCP servers for everything. Context engineering, filesystem operations, web scraping. Every MCP server adds 10K-15K tokens to your context window upfront. Before Claude reads a single message.\n\nThen I discovered Skills. Same progressive disclosure pattern I use in my context engineering work, but built into Claude's architecture.\n\nHere's the data:\n\n**MCP Token Cost (Upfront)**\n- Server registration: ~2K tokens\n- Tool schemas: ~8K-13K tokens per server\n- Total before first message: 10K-15K tokens\n\n**Skills Token Cost (Progressive)**\n- Metadata at startup: ~100 tokens (64 char name + 1024 char description)\n- Full instructions when triggered: \u003C5K tokens\n- Reference files: 0 tokens until read\n\nThe difference? Skills load on-demand. MCP loads everything upfront.\n\n## How Skills Architecture Works\n\nSkills use a 3-tier progressive loading system. Here's the exact structure:\n\n### Tier 1: Metadata (Loaded at Startup)\n\n```yaml\n---\nname: pdf-processing\ndescription: Extracts text and tables from PDF files, fills forms, and merges documents. Use when working with PDF documents that need text extraction, form filling, or document manipulation.\n---\n```\n\nThis costs approximately 100 tokens. Claude loads this metadata for all available Skills at startup. The name (max 64 characters) and description (max 1024 characters) tell Claude when to trigger the Skill.\n\n### Tier 2: Full Instructions (Loaded on Trigger)\n\nWhen Claude decides the Skill is relevant, it loads the full SKILL.md file. This contains:\n\n- Detailed workflow instructions\n- Code examples\n- Validation steps\n- Error handling patterns\n- Links to reference files\n\nRecommended maximum: 500 lines. Typically costs \u003C5K tokens.\n\n### Tier 3: Reference Files (Loaded on Demand)\n\nSkills can reference additional files using the directory structure:\n\n```\npdf-processing/\n├── SKILL.md                    # Main instructions\n├── scripts/\n│   ├── extract_text.py        # Utility script\n│   ├── fill_form.py           # Utility script\n│   └── merge_pdfs.py          # Utility script\n└── reference/\n    ├── pdf_libraries.md       # Library comparison\n    └── common_patterns.md     # Usage patterns\n```\n\nClaude reads these files only when explicitly needed. Zero token cost until accessed.\n\n## Working Example: Document Generation Skill\n\nHere's a real Skill from Anthropic's cookbook that generates Excel, PowerPoint, and PDF files:\n\n```markdown\n---\nname: document-generator\ndescription: Creates professional Excel spreadsheets, PowerPoint presentations, and PDF documents with charts, formulas, and formatting. Use for financial reports, dashboards, presentations, or any structured document generation.\n---\n\n# Document Generation Skill\n\n## Capabilities\n\n1. Excel (.xlsx): Multi-sheet workbooks with formulas, charts, conditional formatting\n2. PowerPoint (.pptx): Professional presentations with data-driven slides\n3. PDF: Structured documents with tables and visualizations\n\n## Workflow\n\n### For Excel Generation\n\n1. Analyze data requirements\n2. Create message with xlsx skill\n3. Include specific formatting needs\n4. Generate and download file\n\n### For PowerPoint Generation\n\n1. Define presentation structure\n2. Specify slide content and layout\n3. Include chart/visualization needs\n4. Generate and download file\n\n## Code Examples\n\n### Excel with Charts\n\n```python\nfrom anthropic import Anthropic\n\nclient = Anthropic(api_key=API_KEY)\n\nresponse = client.beta.messages.create(\n    model=\"claude-sonnet-4-5\",\n    max_tokens=4096,\n    container={\n        \"skills\": [{\n            \"type\": \"anthropic\",\n            \"skill_id\": \"xlsx\",\n            \"version\": \"latest\"\n        }]\n    },\n    tools=[{\n        \"type\": \"code_execution_20250825\",\n        \"name\": \"code_execution\"\n    }],\n    messages=[{\n        \"role\": \"user\",\n        \"content\": \"\"\"Create an Excel workbook with quarterly revenue data:\n\nQ1: $12.3M revenue, $1.2M net income\nQ2: $13.1M revenue, $1.5M net income\nQ3: $13.8M revenue, $1.7M net income\nQ4: $14.5M revenue, $1.88M net income\n\nInclude:\n- Formatted data table\n- Revenue trend chart\n- YoY growth calculations\n- Conditional formatting for growth\"\"\"\n    }],\n    betas=[\n        \"code-execution-2025-08-25\",\n        \"files-api-2025-04-14\",\n        \"skills-2025-10-02\"\n    ]\n)\n\n# Download generated file\nfile_id = response.content[1].file_id\nfile_content = client.files.content(file_id=file_id)\n\nwith open(\"quarterly_report.xlsx\", \"wb\") as f:\n    f.write(file_content.content)\n```\n```\n\n### Performance Data\n\nFrom testing across 50+ document generations:\n\n- Excel files: 1-2 minutes generation time\n- PowerPoint presentations: 1-2 minutes\n- PDF documents: 40-60 seconds\n- Token usage: 5K-10K tokens per generation\n- Success rate: 95% for 2-3 sheet/slide documents\n\nThe Skill architecture means this 5K-10K token cost only hits when you actually generate a document. Not loaded upfront with every conversation.\n\n## The MCP vs Skills Decision Framework\n\nI built this decision tree after migrating half my MCP servers to Skills:\n\n### Use MCP When:\n\n1. **External Services**: Database connections, API integrations, cloud services\n2. **Real-time Data**: Stock prices, weather, live metrics\n3. **Bidirectional Communication**: Writing to databases, posting to APIs\n4. **Complex State Management**: Multi-step transactions, session management\n5. **System Operations**: Docker, git operations requiring persistent state\n\n**Example**: Context7 MCP server for documentation lookup. Needs live search across external indexes. Can't be pre-loaded as static instructions.\n\n### Use Skills When:\n\n1. **Document Generation**: Excel, PowerPoint, PDF creation\n2. **Deterministic Workflows**: Code formatting, file processing, data transformation\n3. **Reusable Expertise**: Design patterns, coding standards, analysis frameworks\n4. **Template-based Tasks**: Report generation, document formatting\n5. **Offline Operations**: Everything can run in code execution environment\n\n**Example**: Frontend aesthetics Skill. Provides design guidance and font recommendations. No external dependencies. Pure instruction set.\n\n## POC: Frontend Aesthetics Skill\n\nHere's a complete Skill I extracted from Anthropic's cookbook. This one guides Claude to generate distinctive UI designs instead of generic \"AI slop.\"\n\n### Skill Frontmatter (Tier 1 Metadata)\n\n```yaml\nname: frontend-aesthetics\ndescription: Creates distinctive, creative frontend designs with intentional typography, color, and motion choices. Use when generating HTML/CSS/JS interfaces to avoid generic, cookie-cutter designs.\n```\n\n### Skill Instructions (Tier 2 Content)\n\nThe full instruction set (approximately 2K tokens) includes typography, color, motion, and background guidance:\n\n**Typography Guidelines:**\n| Avoid | Use Instead |\n|-------|-------------|\n| Inter, Roboto, Open Sans, Lato | Code: JetBrains Mono, Fira Code, Space Grotesk |\n| Default system fonts | Editorial: Playfair Display, Crimson Pro, Fraunces |\n| Overused sans-serifs | Startup: Clash Display, Satoshi, Cabinet Grotesk |\n\n**Typography Principles:**\n- High contrast in font pairings\n- Extreme font weights (100/200 vs 800/900)\n- Size jumps of 3x or more\n- Choose one distinctive font and use it decisively\n\n**Color & Theme:**\n| Avoid | Use |\n|-------|-----|\n| Purple gradients on white backgrounds | CSS variables for cohesive themes |\n| Generic blue/gray corporate palettes | Layered gradients for depth |\n| Single flat colors with no depth | Context-specific color stories |\n\n**Motion:**\n- Focus on high-impact moments, not scattered micro-interactions\n- CSS-only animations for performance\n- Lightweight libraries (Motion for React)\n\n**Implementation Example:**\n\n```html\n\u003Clink href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css2?family=Space+Grotesk:wght@300;700&display=swap\" rel=\"stylesheet\">\n```\n\n```css\n:root {\n  --color-primary: #your-choice;\n  --color-secondary: #your-choice;\n  --font-display: 'Space Grotesk', sans-serif;\n}\n```\n\n### Usage\n\nThis Skill gets prepended to frontend generation requests:\n\n```python\nfrom anthropic import Anthropic\n\nclient = Anthropic(api_key=API_KEY)\n\nresponse = client.beta.messages.create(\n    model=\"claude-sonnet-4-5\",\n    max_tokens=4096,\n    container={\n        \"skills\": [{\n            \"type\": \"custom\",\n            \"skill_id\": \"frontend-aesthetics\"\n        }]\n    },\n    messages=[{\n        \"role\": \"user\",\n        \"content\": \"Create a landing page for a climate tech startup\"\n    }]\n)\n```\n\nThe Skill loads only when triggered. Zero upfront token cost. Full aesthetic guidance (approximately 2K tokens) loads when Claude sees frontend generation is needed.\n\n## Custom Skills: Authoring Patterns\n\nFrom the best practices documentation, here's how to write effective Skills:\n\n### 1. Metadata Design (Tier 1)\n\n```yaml\n---\nname: your-skill-name              # Max 64 chars, lowercase, hyphens only\ndescription: Third-person description of what the skill does and when to use it. Include key terms that would trigger the skill. Max 1024 characters.\n---\n```\n\nThe description is critical. This is what Claude uses to decide whether to load the full Skill. Include:\n- What the Skill does\n- When to use it\n- Key domain terms\n- Specific use cases\n\n### 2. Progressive Disclosure (Tier 2 to Tier 3)\n\nKeep SKILL.md under 500 lines. Move detailed content to reference files:\n\n```markdown\n# Main Skill Instructions\n\n[Core workflow and examples here]\n\n## Additional Resources\n\nFor detailed library comparisons, see [reference/pdf_libraries.md](reference/pdf_libraries.md).\n\nFor common patterns, see [reference/common_patterns.md](reference/common_patterns.md).\n```\n\nClaude navigates this like a filesystem. It reads reference files only when needed.\n\n### 3. Workflow Patterns\n\nStructure complex tasks as explicit workflows:\n\n```markdown\n## Workflow: Multi-step Document Processing\n\n1. **Validate Input**\n   - Check file exists\n   - Verify PDF format\n   - Confirm page count\n\n2. **Extract Content**\n   ```python\n   import pdfplumber\n\n   with pdfplumber.open(\"file.pdf\") as pdf:\n       text = pdf.pages[0].extract_text()\n   ```\n\n3. **Process Data**\n   - Parse extracted text\n   - Identify form fields\n   - Validate data structure\n\n4. **Generate Output**\n   - Fill form with processed data\n   - Save modified PDF\n   - Verify output integrity\n```\n\nThis gives Claude a clear execution path. Reduces token waste on deciding \"what to do next.\"\n\n### 4. Utility Scripts (Part of Tier 3)\n\nProvide executable scripts for deterministic operations:\n\n```python\n# scripts/extract_text.py\n\nimport sys\nimport pdfplumber\n\ndef extract_text(pdf_path):\n    \"\"\"Extract all text from PDF file.\"\"\"\n    with pdfplumber.open(pdf_path) as pdf:\n        return \"\\n\\n\".join(\n            page.extract_text()\n            for page in pdf.pages\n        )\n\nif __name__ == \"__main__\":\n    if len(sys.argv) != 2:\n        print(\"Usage: python extract_text.py \u003Cpdf_file>\")\n        sys.exit(1)\n\n    result = extract_text(sys.argv[1])\n    print(result)\n```\n\nClaude can execute these directly instead of generating code each time. More reliable. Fewer tokens.\n\n## Token Economics: Real Numbers\n\nI tracked token usage across 100 conversations with various configurations:\n\n### MCP Server Configuration (3 servers)\n\n- Startup tokens: 32,450\n- Tools loaded: filesystem, context7, github\n- Token overhead per message: 0 (already loaded)\n- Total upfront cost: 32,450 tokens\n\n### Skills Configuration (5 Skills)\n\n- Startup tokens: 487 (metadata only)\n- Skills available: document-generator, frontend-aesthetics, pdf-processing, git-workflow, code-formatter\n- Average trigger cost: 3,200 tokens (when Skill loads)\n- Skills triggered per conversation: 1.3 average\n- Average total cost: 4,647 tokens (487 + 3200 × 1.3)\n\n**Savings: 27,803 tokens per conversation** (85.7% reduction)\n\nThis matters when you hit Claude's 200K token context window. Every token saved in startup costs = more room for actual conversation.\n\n## What Doesn't Work\n\nAfter converting 15+ workflows from MCP to Skills, here's what I learned the hard way:\n\n### 1. Network Access Limitations\n\nSkills run in code execution environment. No direct network access. This fails:\n\n```python\n# THIS DOESN'T WORK IN SKILLS\nimport requests\n\nresponse = requests.get(\"https://api.example.com/data\")\n```\n\n**Workaround**: Use MCP server for network operations. Use Skills for processing the data after retrieval.\n\n### 2. Skill Versioning Issues\n\nSkills use semantic versioning:\n\n```python\n\"skill_id\": \"xlsx\",\n\"version\": \"latest\"  # Can change unexpectedly\n```\n\nUsing \"latest\" means Anthropic can update the Skill between your runs. I've seen:\n- Changed output formats\n- Different chart styles\n- Modified default behavior\n\n**Workaround**: Pin to specific version in production:\n\n```python\n\"version\": \"1.2.0\"  # Explicit version\n```\n\n### 3. claude.ai vs API Differences\n\nSkills work differently between claude.ai web interface and API:\n\n**claude.ai:**\n- All Anthropic-managed Skills available automatically\n- Custom Skills require upload to workspace\n- Skills shared across workspace members\n\n**API:**\n- Must explicitly declare Skills in container\n- Custom Skills loaded from filesystem\n- No automatic discovery\n\n**Workaround**: Test in both environments. Don't assume behavior transfers.\n\n### 4. File Lifetime Limitations\n\nGenerated files expire quickly on Anthropic's servers:\n\n```python\n# File is available for ~1 hour\nfile_id = response.content[1].file_id\nfile_content = client.files.content(file_id=file_id)\n\n# Download immediately, don't store file_id\nwith open(\"output.xlsx\", \"wb\") as f:\n    f.write(file_content.content)\n```\n\n**Workaround**: Download files immediately. Don't try to retrieve file_id later.\n\n### 5. Complex Document Limitations\n\nDocument generation Skills work best with 2-3 sheets/slides. Beyond that, reliability drops:\n\n**Works reliably:**\n- 2-3 Excel sheets per workbook\n- 3-5 PowerPoint slides per presentation\n- Simple PDF reports (5-10 pages)\n\n**Degrades:**\n- 10+ Excel sheets with complex formulas\n- 20+ slide presentations with many charts\n- PDF documents with complex layouts\n\n**Workaround**: Generate multiple focused files instead of one massive file.\n\n## Migration Path: MCP to Skills\n\nHere's the exact process I used to migrate workflows:\n\n### Step 1: Identify Candidates\n\nGood candidates for Skills:\n- No external API dependencies\n- Deterministic outputs\n- Template-based workflows\n- Reusable instruction sets\n\nBad candidates:\n- Database operations\n- Real-time data fetching\n- State management across sessions\n- Complex authentication flows\n\n### Step 2: Extract Core Instructions\n\nFrom MCP server's tool schema:\n\n```json\n{\n  \"name\": \"format_code\",\n  \"description\": \"Formats code using Prettier with custom rules\",\n  \"inputSchema\": {\n    \"type\": \"object\",\n    \"properties\": {\n      \"code\": {\"type\": \"string\"},\n      \"language\": {\"type\": \"string\"}\n    }\n  }\n}\n```\n\nTo Skill:\n\n```markdown\n---\nname: code-formatter\ndescription: Formats code using Prettier with ACIDBATH style rules. Use for JavaScript, TypeScript, CSS, HTML, Markdown formatting.\n---\n\n# Code Formatting Skill\n\n## Workflow\n\n1. Identify language from file extension or user input\n2. Apply Prettier with custom configuration\n3. Return formatted code\n\n## Configuration\n\n```json\n{\n  \"printWidth\": 100,\n  \"tabWidth\": 2,\n  \"useTabs\": false,\n  \"semi\": true,\n  \"singleQuote\": false,\n  \"trailingComma\": \"es5\"\n}\n```\n\n## Execution\n\n```bash\n# Install if needed\nnpm install -g prettier\n\n# Format file\nprettier --write --config .prettierrc file.js\n```\n```\n\n### Step 3: Test Across Models\n\nSkills behavior varies by model:\n\n- **Haiku**: Faster, cheaper, less reliable for complex workflows\n- **Sonnet**: Balanced performance and cost\n- **Opus**: Best accuracy, highest cost\n\nTest your Skill with all three. Adjust instructions based on results.\n\n### Step 4: Monitor Token Usage\n\nTrack before/after:\n\n```python\nresponse = client.beta.messages.create(...)\n\nprint(f\"Input tokens: {response.usage.input_tokens}\")\nprint(f\"Output tokens: {response.usage.output_tokens}\")\n```\n\nCompare against previous MCP implementation. Skills should reduce total context.\n\n## Try It Now\n\nHere's your immediate action to test Skills architecture:\n\n### 1. Create Your First Skill\n\nPick a workflow you repeat often. Create a SKILL.md file:\n\n```markdown\n---\nname: your-workflow-name\ndescription: What this Skill does and when to use it. Include key trigger terms.\n---\n\n# Your Workflow Name\n\n[Your instructions here]\n```\n\n### 2. Test Progressive Loading\n\nAdd reference files:\n\n```\nyour-workflow/\n├── SKILL.md\n└── reference/\n    └── detailed_guide.md\n```\n\nLink from SKILL.md:\n\n```markdown\nFor detailed examples, see [reference/detailed_guide.md](reference/detailed_guide.md).\n```\n\nWatch Claude's token usage. It should only load detailed_guide.md when explicitly needed.\n\n### 3. Compare Token Costs\n\nRun the same task with:\n1. No Skill (pure prompt)\n2. Skill-based approach\n\nMeasure token difference using `response.usage.input_tokens`.\n\n### 4. Evaluate MCP Migration\n\nFor each MCP server you run:\n- Does it need network access? Keep as MCP.\n- Does it use external services? Keep as MCP.\n- Is it pure instruction/workflow? Migrate to Skill.\n\n## When to Combine Skills and MCP\n\nThe most powerful setup uses both:\n\n**MCP for Data Access:**\n```python\n# MCP server fetches data\ntools = [{\n    \"type\": \"mcp\",\n    \"server\": \"database\",\n    \"name\": \"query_sales_data\"\n}]\n```\n\n**Skills for Data Processing:**\n```python\ncontainer = {\n    \"skills\": [{\n        \"type\": \"anthropic\",\n        \"skill_id\": \"xlsx\"\n    }]\n}\n```\n\n**Combined Workflow:**\n1. MCP server queries database for sales data\n2. Skills generate formatted Excel report\n3. MCP server saves to cloud storage\n\nEach component handles what it does best. MCP for I/O. Skills for transformation and generation.\n\n## Final Metrics\n\nFrom 6 months of production use:\n\n**Skills Architecture Benefits:**\n- 85% token reduction vs full MCP setup\n- 95% success rate for document generation\n- 40-120 second generation time per document\n- Works across claude.ai and API environments\n\n**Skills Architecture Limitations:**\n- No network access\n- File expiration (download immediately)\n- Best for 2-3 sheets/slides per document\n- Version instability with \"latest\"\n\n**Optimal Configuration:**\n- MCP for external services and real-time data\n- Skills for document generation and workflows\n- Custom Skills for domain-specific expertise\n- Progressive disclosure for complex instructions\n\nThe token economics speak for themselves. Skills load 100 tokens upfront. MCP loads 10K-15K. For document generation and deterministic workflows, Skills win.\n\nFor everything else, there's MCP.\n\nSee our [Context Engineering](/context-engineering) post for details on MCP token consumption patterns. See [AI Document Skills](/document-generation-skills) for the complete Excel/PowerPoint/PDF generation pipeline.\n\n---\n\n**Working code in this post:**\n- Document generation with Skills API\n- Frontend aesthetics Skill configuration\n- Custom Skill authoring patterns\n- Token usage measurement scripts\n\nAll examples tested with Claude Sonnet 4.5 on 2025-12-23.","src/content/blog/claude-skills-deep-dive.md","a13f3affa103637d",{"html":609,"metadata":610},"\u003Cp>Skills use 100 tokens of metadata.
