# Ameno Finalize

Generate edit suggestions to add Ameno voice personality to appropriate sections. Uses suggest_edits pattern - **suggests** changes, never auto-applies.

## Usage

```bash
/ameno-finalize src/content/blog/your-post.md
```

## Philosophy

**Creation**: Write in ACIDBATH's direct, technical voice (via `/new-post`)
**Finalization**: **Suggest** Ameno voice edits for specific sections that benefit from personality
**Application**: User reviews suggestions and applies selectively

The Ameno voice exists for **simplification** - making difficult concepts accessible without dumbing them down. It's not about catchphrases or forced metaphors.

**CRITICAL**: This command now **suggests** edits instead of auto-applying them. Original file is never modified.

---

## Process

### 1. Read the Post

Read the file using Read tool: $ARGUMENTS

### 2. Classify Sections

Identify section types:

| Section Type | Action | Transformation |
|--------------|--------|----------------|
| Introduction | **PRESERVE** | Keep direct - facts and results |
| Concept explanation | **SUGGEST EDIT** | Simplify without metaphor abuse |
| Code examples | **PRESERVE** | Keep clean - let code speak |
| Benchmarks/numbers | **PRESERVE** | Keep specific and verifiable |
| Failure modes | **SUGGEST EDIT** | Add conversational honesty |
| Configuration/steps | **PRESERVE** | Keep step-by-step, no narrative |
| Takeaways | **SUGGEST EDIT** | Add memorable style |

### 3. Generate Edit Suggestions

For sections that benefit from Ameno voice:

**Simplification** (primary technique):
- Restate complex things in plain terms
- Add significance: "That means..." / "That's 20% of your context gone."
- NO forced metaphors

**Conversational honesty** (for failure modes):
- "This is where it bites you"
- "Here's what actually happens"
- Direct about limitations

**Memorable closes** (for takeaways):
- Style without fluff
- "The optimization is invisible. Your agent just works faster."

### 4. Typography Review

Before generating edit suggestions, verify typography compliance:

**Callout Variants Check**:
- Valid: `note`, `tip`, `info`, `warning`, `danger`, `quote`
- Deprecated (flag for fix): `success`, `insight`, `data`

**Code Block Check**:
- Blocks >15 lines should have `collapse={lines}` meta-string
- Example: ` ```python collapse={12-50} `

If deprecated callouts or missing collapse are found, add to suggestions output:

```markdown
## Typography Issues Found

**Deprecated Callout Variants**:
- Line X: `type="success"` → Change to `type="tip"` or `type="note"`
- Line Y: `type="insight"` → Change to `type="note"` or `type="tip"`

**Code Blocks Missing Collapse**:
- Lines A-B: 45-line Python block → Add `collapse={12-45}`
```

### 5. Avoid Anti-Patterns

Do NOT suggest edits that:
- [ ] Add forced metaphors where direct explanation works
- [ ] Deploy catchphrases excessively
- [ ] Inject personality into introductions
- [ ] Add "Think of it like..." unnecessary analogies
- [ ] Overuse "here's where things get weird" style phrases

### 6. Output Suggestions Only

**NEVER write to the file**. Only output suggestions in suggest_edits format.

## Summary

**Total Suggestions**: {N}
**Editable Sections Found**: {N}
**Sections Preserved**: {N}

**Focus Areas**:
- Simplifying concept explanations
- Adding conversational honesty to failure modes
- Making takeaways memorable

---

## Suggested Edit {N}: {Section Name}

**Type**: {concept-explanation|failure-mode|takeaway}
**Rationale**: {Why this simplification improves clarity without adding metaphor}

### Before
```
{exact original content}
```

### After
```
{Ameno voice transformation}
```

### Apply This Edit?
- [ ] Yes, apply as-is
- [ ] Apply with modifications
- [ ] Skip this edit

---

{Repeat for each suggestion}

---

## Sections Intentionally Preserved

The following sections were **not** edited to maintain directness and technical accuracy:

- **Introduction** (introduction): Stays direct - facts and results first
- **Code Examples** (technical): Clean code without narrative
- **Benchmarks** (technical): Specific, verifiable numbers preserved

---

## Application Notes

1. **Review rationale** for each suggestion
2. **Preserve direct voice** in introductions and code
3. **Apply selectively** - not all suggestions may fit
4. **Avoid metaphor abuse** - if unsure, skip the edit

## Next Steps

- [ ] Review all suggested edits
- [ ] Apply selected edits to source file
- [ ] Verify introductions stay direct
- [ ] Verify code blocks remain clean
```

---

## Example Suggestion Format

**Suggested Edit 1: Context Overhead Explanation**

**Type**: concept-explanation
**Rationale**: Simplifies abstract "computational overhead" to concrete cost impact ("$0.40 per conversation"). Adds significance through specific comparison without introducing metaphor. Fits concept-explanation type where clarity improves understanding.

**Before**:
```
Context window consumption averages 180K tokens in typical sessions. This represents a significant computational overhead.
```

**After**:
```
Context consumption averages 180K tokens per session. That's $0.40 per conversation before you even start.
```

**Apply This Edit?**
- [ ] Yes, apply as-is
