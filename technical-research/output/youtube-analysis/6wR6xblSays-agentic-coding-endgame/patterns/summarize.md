# ONE SENTENCE SUMMARY:

Custom agents built with specialized system prompts and tools outperform generic agents for domain-specific engineering problems.

# MAIN POINTS:

1. Agentic engineering progression follows: better agents, more agents, then custom agents for maximum impact.
2. Out-of-the-box agents work for everyone but lack specialization for your specific codebase.
3. System prompts are the most critical element determining agent behavior and capabilities completely.
4. Custom tools through MCP servers enable agents to perform domain-specific operations effectively.
5. Claude Code SDK provides incremental building blocks for creating specialized agent workflows.
6. Multi-agent systems can orchestrate complex workflows like software development life cycles.
7. Model selection affects cost and performance; simpler tasks can use cheaper models.
8. Context window management requires controlling which tools agents have access to carefully.
9. Agent conversations can be continuous using SDK client versus one-off query commands.
10. Custom agents excel at hard, specific problems most engineers cannot solve easily.

# TAKEAWAYS:

1. Master system prompt engineering first since it multiplies the effectiveness of every user interaction.
2. Build custom tools only when out-of-the-box solutions don't fit your specific domain requirements.
3. Use multi-agent orchestration for complex workflows that benefit from specialized roles and handoffs.
4. Choose appropriate models based on task complexity to optimize cost versus capability tradeoffs.
5. Focus custom agent development on high-ROI problems with repetitive workflows in your engineering stack.
