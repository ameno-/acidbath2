# IDEAS

- Claude Code introduced sub-agent feature for better context management and optimization.
- Initial user experiences with sub-agents were negative due to slowness and poor results.
- Sub-agents consume excessive tokens and trigger conversation compacting which degrades performance.
- Context compacting causes agents to lose important information about previous actions taken.
- Task tool allows main agent to delegate work to specialized sub-agents effectively.
- Sub-agents have identical tool sets but operate in isolated conversation contexts.
- Parent agents only see task assignment and completion summaries, not detailed steps.
- Token consumption gets reduced from massive file reads to concise summary reports.
- Sub-agents work best for research and information gathering rather than implementation.
- Implementation-focused sub-agents fail because they lack cross-context awareness and history.
- Frontend and backend specialized agents cannot share implementation context between sessions.
- Each sub-agent task creates contained sessions without knowledge of other agents' work.
- Parent agents have limited visibility into specific files and changes made by sub-agents.
- Context sharing problems will likely be resolved in future Claude Code versions.
- Best practice treats sub-agents as researchers who provide summaries to main conversation.
- Adam Wolf from Claude team confirms sub-agents excel at information retrieval tasks.
- Service-specific expert agents can be created for platforms like Vercel, Supabase, Tailwind.
- Expert agents should be equipped with latest documentation and specialized knowledge bases.
- MCP tools enable agents to retrieve relevant components and design patterns efficiently.
- File system serves as ultimate context management system for long-running tasks.
- Tool results should be saved to local files rather than conversation history.
- Web scraping content gets stored in markdown files for later retrieval.
- Context files in doc/task folders maintain project state across different agents.
- Sub-agents read context files before starting work to understand project status.
- Research reports get saved as markdown files for parent agent consumption.
- Context file updates document completed work and maintain project continuity.
- Chassis expert agents use specialized MCP tools for component and design retrieval.
- System prompts should include detailed documentation for consistent best practices.
- Migration guides help agents understand differences between software versions clearly.
- Global agent settings apply across all projects while project-specific agents remain local.
- Agent creation requires careful prompt engineering and output format specification.
- Goals should explicitly state research-only focus and prohibit direct implementation work.
- Output formats guide agents to create proper documentation and file structures.
- Rules prevent sub-agents from calling themselves and creating infinite loops.
- Context session files track overall project progress and architectural decisions made.
- Parent agents must delegate tasks with proper context file references included.
- Background sessions allow continuous monitoring and execution of long-running development tasks.
- High-fidelity UI implementations can be achieved through proper component planning.
- Error fixing becomes easier when parent agents maintain full implementation context.
- Vercel AI SDK integration requires specialized agents with v5 documentation knowledge.
- Real-time AI chat functionality can be implemented through proper SDK integration.
- Production-tested templates provide reliable foundations for new development projects.
- Weekly sessions help developers learn and share best practices for AI-assisted development.
