## Key Quotes

> "Once again, my MCP server just ate 10,000 tokens before my agent even started working."

> "Stack up two or three more MCP servers, and I'll be bleeding 20% plus context in no time."

> "When you have less garbage context, your agent can perform better."

> "You can sidestep every single context engineering problem by just focusing your agents on one problem and then you delete them when they're done."

> "Even before context comes prompt engineering. This is still a critical skill. In fact, it is the critical skill for engineers in 2025 and beyond."

> "CLI works for you, works for your team, and your agents understand it as well."

> "Everything has trade-offs, right? It's not just that we want to go beyond MCP and that MCP is bad."

> "Stay focused and keep building."

## Conclusion

This video provides essential knowledge for developers working with AI agents and external tool integration. The core message is clear: **context window preservation often matters more than standardization**.

The three proven alternatives (CLI tools, file system scripts, Claude skills) each offer different trade-offs between simplicity, control, and context preservation. The 80/15/5 rule provides practical guidance for when to use each approach.

Most importantly, the video emphasizes that these are trade-offs, not absolutes. Understanding when to use each approach based on your constraints is the key skill to develop.

**Final Takeaway**: Build CLI-first tools with progressive disclosure to preserve agent context while maintaining control. Prompt engineer before context engineer, and remember that focused single-purpose agents sidestep most context engineering problems entirely.
