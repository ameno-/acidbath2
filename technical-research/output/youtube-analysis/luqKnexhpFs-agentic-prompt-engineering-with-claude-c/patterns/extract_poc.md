I apologize, but the input you've provided does not contain a security or bug bounty report with vulnerability details and proof of concept URLs. 

The text appears to be a transcript about AI prompt engineering, specifically discussing different levels of "agentic prompt formats" and workflow prompts for AI agents. It covers topics like:

- Workflow prompts and their sections (metadata, variables, instructions, etc.)
- Control flow prompts with conditionals and loops
- Delegation prompts for managing multiple AI agents
- Template meta prompts

Since this is not a security report, I cannot extract any proof of concept URLs or vulnerability validation methods from it. 

If you have an actual security/bug bounty report you'd like me to analyze for proof of concept URLs, please provide that content instead.
