## Style Comparison: Same Context, Different Styles

### Context: "Token optimization reduced API costs"

This example shows how the same information would look across different callout styles.

---

#### Version A: Insight Highlight

**Rationale**: Emphasizing the insight that optimization matters

**Visual**: Glowing acid-green hexagonal card with abstract glow at center. Particle shimmer suggests "aha moment". Focus on the realization rather than the metric.

**When to use**: When emphasizing the discovery/insight over the raw number.

---

#### Version B: Warning Alert (Not Appropriate)

**Why not**: This is positive information (cost reduction), not a warning. Warning style would send wrong message.

**Skip this style for this context**.

---

#### Version C: Data Spotlight

**Rationale**: Emphasizing the quantitative result

**Visual**: Large "95%" or "$4.2K SAVED" in glowing green/cyan. Dramatic spotlight. Bold number dominates.

**When to use**: When the specific metric is what matters most. Let the numbers speak.

---

#### Version D: Tech Detail

**Rationale**: Explaining the optimization mechanism

**Visual**: Glass or holographic object representing the optimization technique itself (perhaps a streamlined processor or efficient pipeline visual).

**When to use**: When explaining HOW the optimization works, not just the result.

---

**Selection Priority for This Context**: Data Spotlight (Version C) is primary recommendation because specific metric is most impactful. Insight Highlight (Version A) is alternative if focusing on the broader realization.
