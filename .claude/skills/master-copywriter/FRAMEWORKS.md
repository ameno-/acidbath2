## Cialdini's 6 Principles of Influence

### Overview
Core persuasion psychology from Dr. Robert Cialdini's research on influence and compliance.

### 1. Reciprocity

**Principle**: People feel obligated to return favors.

**Application**: Give value before asking.

**Example**:
```
❌ "Sign up for our newsletter"
✅ "Download our complete 50-page guide to [topic] - the same playbook our
$50K/year clients use. Enter your email to get it instantly."
```

### 2. Commitment & Consistency

**Principle**: People align behavior with past commitments.

**Application**: Get small yeses leading to big yes.

**Example**:
```
❌ "Buy our enterprise plan"
✅ "If you agree that [belief reader holds], then [logical next step that leads
to your solution]. Start with our free tier and see the difference."
```

### 3. Social Proof

**Principle**: People follow what others like them do.

**Application**: Show adoption by similar peers.

**Example**:
```
❌ "Many companies use us"
✅ "1,247 SaaS companies including Stripe, Airbnb, and Dropbox rely on our
infrastructure. Here's Stripe's engineering lead explaining why they chose us..."
```

### 4. Authority

**Principle**: People trust and follow experts.

**Application**: Establish credentials before persuading.

**Example**:
```
❌ "We know security"
✅ "Our security team includes three former NSA cryptographers and the engineer
who discovered Heartbleed. They've spent 50,000 hours hardening this system.
Here's their white paper..."
```

### 5. Liking

**Principle**: People say yes to those they like and relate to.

**Application**: Find common ground, show understanding.

**Example**:
```
❌ "Our solution works"
✅ "We've been where you are. Three years ago, our team struggled with the exact
same [problem]. We tried [what reader tried]. It failed. Here's what worked..."
```

### 6. Scarcity

**Principle**: People value what's limited.

**Application**: Genuine limitation, not fake urgency.

**Example**:
```
❌ "Only 2 left! Buy now!"
✅ "Our consulting team takes 10 clients per quarter to maintain quality. We're
at 7 for Q2. Here's our case study library if you're considering working with us."
```

## StoryBrand Framework

### Overview
Donald Miller's 7-part story structure for brand messaging.

### Structure

1. **Character**: Customer is the hero
2. **Problem**: What they're struggling with
3. **Guide**: You're the expert helper
4. **Plan**: Clear path to solution
5. **Call**: Invitation to act
6. **Success**: What victory looks like
7. **Avoid Failure**: What happens if they don't act

### Application

```markdown
**[Character - Customer as Hero]**
You're a startup CTO managing infrastructure while building product.

**[Problem - Their Struggle]**
Every outage pulls you from feature development. You're firefighting instead of building.

**[Guide - You as Expert]**
We've managed infrastructure for 1,247 startups. We know the pain of 2am pages.

**[Plan - Clear Path]**
Connect your app in 15 minutes. We handle monitoring, scaling, and alerts.

**[Call - Invitation]**
Start your 14-day trial. No credit card needed.

**[Success - Victory Vision]**
Ship features instead of fixing servers. Sleep through the night. Scale without stress.

**[Avoid Failure - Stakes]**
Every hour on infrastructure is an hour your competitor spends on product.
```

## Hero's Journey (Narrative Arc)

### Overview
Classic storytelling structure for case studies and customer stories.

### Structure

1. **Ordinary World**: Customer's before state
2. **Call to Adventure**: Problem demands solution
3. **Meeting the Mentor**: Discovery of your solution
4. **Crossing Threshold**: Decision to try/buy
5. **Tests & Challenges**: Implementation journey
6. **Transformation**: Results achieved
7. **Return with Elixir**: Success and insights

### Application Example

```markdown
**[Ordinary World]**
Sarah's team was deploying once a week. Every release meant weekend stress.

**[Call to Adventure]**
A major bug reached production Friday night. The team worked until 2am. Sarah
knew something had to change.

**[Meeting the Mentor]**
She found our CI/CD platform at a conference. The demo showed automated testing
catching bugs before merge.

**[Crossing Threshold]**
Monday morning, Sarah connected their GitHub repo. First automated test run in 20 minutes.

**[Tests & Challenges]**
Week one: Learning to write good tests. Week two: Integrating with their deployment pipeline.

**[Transformation]**
Month three: 50 deployments. Zero production bugs. Zero weekend work.

**[Return]**
"We ship 10x more, break nothing, and I sleep through weekends. Here's our
full case study..."
```

## Inverted Pyramid (Journalistic Structure)

### Overview
Lead with most important information, add detail progressively.

### Structure

1. **Lead**: Most critical info (who, what, result)
2. **Body**: Supporting details and context
3. **Tail**: Background and nice-to-know

### Application

```markdown
**[Lead - Critical Info]**
Stripe increased transaction processing speed 10x while cutting costs 40% using
our distributed database architecture.

**[Body - Supporting Details]**
Their legacy system handled 5M transactions/day but couldn't scale beyond that.
Peak traffic created bottlenecks. Our solution distributed load across 50 nodes,
each handling 1M transactions independently.

**[Tail - Background]**
The migration took 6 months with zero downtime. Stripe's infrastructure team
documented the entire process. Download their case study for implementation details.
```

## Before-After-Bridge (Transformation Framework)

### Structure

**Before**: Pain state
**After**: Success state
**Bridge**: How you enable transformation

### Master Copywriter Adaptation

Emphasize social proof and credibility in bridge:

```markdown
**[Before - Pain State]**
Acme Corp's sales team used 7 different tools. Data scattered. No single source
of truth. Deals fell through cracks.

**[After - Success State]**
Now: One dashboard. Real-time pipeline visibility. 34% more deals closed. Zero
data entry (automated from email and calls).

**[Bridge - Credible Path]**
We've unified sales tools for 500+ companies. Average time-to-value: 2 weeks.
Here's Salesforce's VP explaining how we integrated their 12 legacy systems...
```

## FAB with Proof (Features-Advantages-Benefits + Evidence)

### Structure

1. **Feature**: What it is
2. **Advantage**: Why it's better
3. **Benefit**: What customer gets
4. **Proof**: Evidence it works

### Application

```markdown
**[Benefit]** Your customer data stays encrypted even from you.
**[Advantage]** Zero-knowledge architecture means we can't decrypt your data even if compelled.
**[Feature]** 256-bit encryption with customer-held keys.
**[Proof]** Audited by Trail of Bits. SOC 2 Type II certified. Here's the security white paper.
```

## Framework Selection for Master Copywriter

**Building authority?** → Cialdini (Authority + Social Proof)
**Telling customer story?** → Hero's Journey or StoryBrand
**Establishing credibility quickly?** → Inverted Pyramid
**Selling transformation?** → Before-After-Bridge with social proof
**Explaining value?** → FAB with Proof

**Combine frameworks**:
- StoryBrand structure + Cialdini principles for persuasive narrative
- Hero's Journey for case studies + Social Proof for credibility
- Inverted Pyramid for thought leadership + Authority signals

## Application to suggest_edits

When generating Master Copywriter suggestions, cite frameworks in rationale:

```
**Rationale**: Applies Cialdini's Social Proof principle by citing specific companies
(Stripe, 1,247 users) and quantified results (10x speed, 40% cost reduction). Uses
Inverted Pyramid structure to lead with result before mechanism. Builds credibility
through specificity and proof access (case study link).
```

This frameworks library ensures every Master Copywriter suggestion has psychological grounding in persuasion research.
