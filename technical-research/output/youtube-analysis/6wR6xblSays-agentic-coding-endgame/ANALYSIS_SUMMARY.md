## Top 3 Insights

1. **System Prompts Are Foundational** - System prompts completely redefine agents, transforming existing models into entirely new specialized computational products. They multiply the effect of every user prompt interaction.

2. **Agent Progression Model** - Agent engineering follows predictable progression: (1) better agents through prompt engineering, (2) more agents to scale compute, then (3) custom specialized agents for domain-specific problems.

3. **Context Window Efficiency** - Out-of-box agents carry 15+ unnecessary tools that consume context window space. Custom agents solve this by providing only needed tools, critical as systems scale.
